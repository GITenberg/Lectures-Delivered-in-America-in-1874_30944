1</span>LECTURE I.<br />
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</h2>
<p>Reverence for age, at least so it has long seemed to me,
reverence for age, I say, is a fair test of the vigour of youth;
and, conversely, insolence toward the old and the past, whether
in individuals or in nations, is a sign rather of weakness than
of strength.&nbsp; And the cause, I think, is this.&nbsp; The
rich and strong young natures, which feel themselves capable of
original thought and work, have a corresponding respect for those
who, in the generations gone by, have thought and worked as they
hope to do hereafter.&nbsp; And this temper, understand me, so
far from being servile, or even merely conservative, usually
accompanies true independence of spirit.&nbsp; The young athlete,
like the young race-horse, does not despise, but emulate, his
sire; even though the old victor be long past his prime.&nbsp;
The young soldier admires the old general; <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the young
midshipman the old admiral, just in proportion as he himself is
likely to be a daring and able officer hereafter.&nbsp; The son,
when grown to man&rsquo;s estate, may say to his father, I look
on you still with all respect and admiration.&nbsp; I have
learnt, and desire always, to learn from you.&nbsp; But you must
be to me now, not a dictator, but an example.&nbsp; You became
what you are by following your own line; and you must let me
rival you, and do you honour, by following mine.</p>
<p>This, I believe, is true of nations as well as of
individuals.&nbsp; I do not hesitate to say that, paradoxical as
it may seem, the most original races&mdash;those who have
succeeded best and left their stamp most broadly and permanently
on the human race&mdash;have also been the most teachable,
provided they were allowed to learn in their own way and to adapt
to their own purposes any higher ancient civilisation with which
they came in contact.&nbsp; What more striking instances of this
truth&mdash;for truth it is&mdash;than the reverence of the free
Republican Greek for the old despotic civilisation of Egypt? and
of the free Norseman, our own ancestor, for the old and equally
despotic civilisation of Rome?</p>
<p>These&mdash;the two most originative and most progressive
races of Europe&mdash;had a faith in, an awe of, the supposed or
real wisdom of the men of old time, which was often exaggerated
into a superstition; but <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>never&mdash;thanks to their own innate
force&mdash;degenerated into a bondage.</p>
<p>Pardon me this somewhat dry pro&oelig;mium; and pardon me,
too, if it leads me on to a compliment to the American people,
which I trust you will not think impertinent.</p>
<p>For I have seen, and seen with joy, a like spirit in those
Americans whom it has been my good fortune to meet in my own
land.&nbsp; I mean this:&mdash;That I found in them, however
self-teaching and self-determining they might be, that genial
reverence for antiquity which I hold to be the sign of a truly
generous&mdash;that is in the right sense of the grand old
word&mdash;a truly high-bred, nature.&nbsp; I have been touched,
and deeply touched, at finding so many of them, on landing for
the first time at Liverpool, hurrying off to our quaint old city
of Chester to gaze on its old girdle of walls and towers; Roman,
Medi&aelig;val, Caroline; its curious &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; of
overhanging houses; its fragments of Roman baths and
inscriptions; its modest little Cathedral; and the&mdash;really
very few&mdash;relics of English history which it contains.&nbsp;
Even two banners of an old Cheshire regiment which had been in
the Peninsular war were almost as interesting, to some, as an
illuminated Bible of the early Middle Age.&nbsp; More than once
have I had to repress the enthusiasm of some charming lady and
say, &lsquo;But this is nothing.&nbsp; Do not waste your
admiration here.&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp; See the British Museum, <!--
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>its
marbles and its manuscripts&mdash;See the French Cathedrals; the
ruins of Provence and Italy; the galleries of Florence, Naples,
Rome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but you must remember,&rsquo; was the answer,
&lsquo;these are the first old things I ever saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A mere sentiment?&nbsp; Yes: but as poets know, and statesmen
ought to know, it is by sentiment, when well directed&mdash;as by
sorrow, when well used&mdash;by sentiment, I say, great nations
live.&nbsp; When sentiment dies out, and mere prosaic calculation
of loss and profit takes its place, then comes a Byzantine epoch,
a Chinese epoch, decrepitude, and slow decay.</p>
<p>And so the eagerness of those generous young souls was to me a
good augury for the future, of them, and of their native
land.&nbsp; They seemed to me&mdash;and I say again it touched
me, often deeply&mdash;to be realising to themselves their
rightful place in the community of the civilised nations of all
lands, and of all times&mdash;realising to themselves that they
were indeed</p>
<blockquote><p>Heirs of all the ages, foremost in the ranks of
time;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and minded, therefore, like wise and noble heirs, not to
despise and squander, but to treasure and to use that
inheritance, and the accumulated labours of the mighty dead.</p>
<p>I saw this, I say, at Chester.&nbsp; And therefore I was not
surprised to find the pleasant experience repeated, and to even a
higher degree, at Westminster.&nbsp; <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>A pleasant
experience, I say.&nbsp; I know few more agreeable occupations
than showing a party of Americans round our own great Abbey; and
sentimentalising, if you will, in sympathy with them, over
England&rsquo;s Pantheon.</p>
<p>I pause to confess once more that it is almost an impertinence
in me to pay you such a compliment.&nbsp; You have a right to
answer me&mdash;How could it be otherwise?&mdash;Are we not
educated people?&nbsp; Has not our taste been trained by native
authors, who were at least civilised enough to value the great
past, without the need of any European crossing the seas to tell
us of its wealth?</p>
<p>If you reprove me thus, I can but say that the reproof is
just, and will remain just, as long as your poets are what they
are; and as long, above all, as you reverence as much in America
as we do in England, the poetry of Mr. Longfellow.&nbsp; He has
not, if I recollect aright, ever employed his muse in
commemorating our great Abbey; but that muse is instinct with all
those lofty and yet tender emotions which the sight of that great
Abbey should call out.&nbsp; He knows, as few know on our side of
the wide water, the effect, chastening and yet ennobling, of such
architecture, consecrated by such associations.&nbsp; He has not
only perceived and drank in all that is purest and noblest in the
now sleeping last ten centuries: but he has combined it, again
and again, with that which is purest <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and noblest in
the waking and yearning present; and combined it organically and
livingly, as leaf and stem combines with flower and fruit.&nbsp;
Yes; as long as the poet who could write both the <i>Belfry of
Bruges</i> and <i>The Village Blacksmith</i> is read among you,
there is no need for me to bid you reverence the past; and little
need, I trust, for me to tell those whom I leave at home to
reverence the present.&nbsp; For it is a fact&mdash;of which some
Americans may not be as well aware as they should be&mdash;that
your exquisite poet has exercised an influence in Britain it may
be as great as, and certainly more varied than, that which he has
exercised in his native land.&nbsp; With us&mdash;as, I presume,
with you&mdash;he has penetrated into thousands of Puritan homes,
and awakened tens of thousands of young hearts to the beauty and
the nobleness of the old pre-Reformation age, and of that romance
and art from which their too exclusive hereditary training had,
until his time, shut them out.&nbsp; And he has thus, truly, done
a sacred deed in turning the hearts of the children to their
fathers.&nbsp; That was enough: but that is not the whole.&nbsp;
He has, conversely, turned the hearts of the fathers to the
children.&nbsp; The world-wide humanity of his poems, and, to be
just, of all your American poets who have studied in his school,
has produced throughout Great Britain a just reverence and
affection for the American mind which will have&mdash;which has
had already&mdash;<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>large social and political
results.&nbsp; Be sure, be sure, that in spite of passing jars,
our empire will never be long unjust to yours, while Mr.
Longfellow and Mr. Lowell remain not merely the household
bards&mdash;though that is much&mdash;but counsellors,
comforters, and trusted friends to hundreds of thousands of
gentle and earnest souls; from the palace to the parsonage, from
the little village shop to the farm-house on the lonely down.</p>
<p>But there is another American author&mdash;who was the delight
of my own youth, and who should have been my teacher also, for he
was a master of our common tongue, and his prose is as graceful
and felicitous as poor Elia&rsquo;s own, and it is certainly more
manly&mdash;another American author, I say, who, with that
high-bred reverence for what is old, has told you already more
about Westminster Abbey, and told it better, than I am likely to
tell it.&nbsp; Need I say that I mean the lamented Washington
Irving?&nbsp; Ah, that our authors had always been as just to you
as he was just to us; and indeed more than just; for in his
courtesy and geniality he saw us somewhat <i>en beau</i>, and
treated old John Bull too much as the poet advises us to treat
young and fair ladies&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Be to their faults a little blind,<br />
Be to their virtues very kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what a charming book is that old
&lsquo;Sketch-book.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>And what a
charming essay that on our great Abbey, set with such gems of
prose as these,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the
square of the cloisters, beaming upon a scanty spot of grass in
the centre, and lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with
a kind of dusty splendour.&nbsp; From between the arcades, the
eye glanced up to a bit of blue sky, or a passing cloud, and
beheld the sun-gilt pinnacles of the Abbey towering into the
azure heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Or this again, describing the general effect of Henry the
Seventh&rsquo;s unrivalled chapel,&mdash;&lsquo;The very walls
are wrought into universal ornament; encrusted with tracery, and
scooped into niches, crowded with the statues of saints and
martyrs.&nbsp; Stone seems, by the cunning labour of the chisel,
to have been robbed of its weight and density; suspended aloft as
if by magic; and the fretted roof achieved with the wonderful
minuteness and airy security of a cobweb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dusty splendour,&rsquo; &lsquo;airy security,&rsquo;
epithets so unexpected, and yet so felicitous, as to be seemingly
accidental.&nbsp; Such are the tokens of that highest art, which
is&mdash;to conceal its own existence.&nbsp; After such speech as
that, what have I to tell you of the great old Abbey?</p>
<p>Yet there are one or two things, I dare to say, which
Washington Irving would have written differently had he visited
Westminster, not forty years ago, but now.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>I think, in the first place, that if he visited the great
Abbey now, he would not have noticed that look of dilapidation at
which he hints&mdash;and perhaps had a right to hint&mdash;some
forty years ago.&nbsp; Dilapidation, dirt, and negligence are as
hateful to us now, as to the builder of the newest house
outside.&nbsp; We too, for more than a generation past, have
felt, in common with the rest of England and with all the nations
of Northern Europe, that awakened reverence for Medi&aelig;val
Art and Medi&aelig;val History, which is&mdash;for good and for
evil&mdash;the special social phenomenon of our times; the
natural and, on the whole, useful countercheck to that extreme of
revolutionary feeling which issues&mdash;as it did in Paris but
three years ago&mdash;in utter hatred and renunciation of the
past, and destruction of its monuments.</p>
<p>To preserve, to restore, and, if not, to copy, as a sort of
filial duty, the buildings which our forefathers have left us, is
now held to be the very mark of cultivation and good taste in
Britain.&nbsp; It may be that we carry it too far; that by a
servile and Chinese exactness of imitation we are crippling what
originality of genius may exist among our draughtsmen, sculptors,
architects.&nbsp; But we at least confess thereby that we cannot
invent and create as could our ancestors five hundred years ago;
and as long as that is the case it is more wise in us&mdash;as in
any people&mdash;to exhaust the signification and power of the
past, and to learn all <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>we can from older schools of art and
thought ere we attempt novelties of our own which, I confess
freely, usually issue in the ugly and the ludicrous.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, we of Westminster Abbey have become, like
other Englishmen, repairers and restorers.&nbsp; Had we not so
become, the nation would have demanded an account of us, as
guardians of its national mausoleum, the building of which our
illustrious Dean has so well said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of all the characteristics of Westminster Abbey, that
which most endears it to the nation and gives most force to its
name&mdash;which has, more than anything else, made it the home
of the people of England and the most venerated fabric of the
English Church&mdash;is not so much its glory as the seat of the
coronations, or as the sepulchre of the kings; not so much its
school, or its monastery, or its chapter, or its sanctuary, as
the fact that it is the resting-place of famous Englishmen, from
every rank and creed, and every form of genius.&nbsp; It is not
only Reims Cathedral and St. Denys both in one; but it is what
the Pantheon was intended to be to France&mdash;what the Valhalla
is to Germany&mdash;what Santa Croce is to Italy. . . It is this
which inspired the saying of Nelson&mdash;Victory or Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; It is this which has intertwined it with so many
eloquent passages of Macaulay.&nbsp; It is this which gives point
to the allusions of recent Nonconformist statesmen, least
inclined to draw illustrations <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>from
ecclesiastical buildings.&nbsp; It is this which gives most
promise of vitality to the whole institution.&nbsp; Kings are no
longer buried within its walls; even the splendour of pageants
has ceased to attract.&nbsp; But the desire to be buried in
Westminster Abbey is as strong as ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This sprang, in the first instance, as a natural
off-shoot from the coronations and interments of the kings.&nbsp;
Had they, like those of France, of Spain, of Austria, of
Russia&mdash;been buried far away in some secluded spot, or had
the English nation stood aloof from the English monarchy, it
might have been otherwise.&nbsp; The sepulchral chapels built by
Henry the Third and Henry the Seventh might have stood alone in
their glory.&nbsp; No meaner dust need ever have mingled with the
dust of Plantagenets, Tudors, Stuarts, and Guelphs. . . .&nbsp;
But it has been the peculiar privilege of the kings of England
that neither in life nor in death have they been parted from
their people.&nbsp; As the Council of the Nation and the Courts
of Law have pressed into the Palace of Westminster, and engirdled
the very throne itself, so the ashes of the great citizens of
England have pressed into the sepulchre of the kings, and
surrounded them as with a guard of honour after their
death.&nbsp; We are sometimes inclined bitterly to contrast the
placid dignity of our recumbent kings, with Chatham gesticulating
from the northern transept, or Pitt from the western door, or
Shakspeare <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>leaning on his column in Poet&rsquo;s
Corner, or Wolfe expiring by the chapel of St. John.&nbsp; But,
in fact, they are, in their different ways, keeping guard over
the shrine of our monarchs and our laws; and their very
incongruity and variety become symbols of that harmonious
diversity in unity which pervades our whole
commonwealth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honoured by such a trust, we who serve God daily in the great
Abbey are not unmindful of the duty which lies on us to preserve
and to restore, to the best of our power, the general fabric; and
to call on government and on private persons to preserve and
restore those monuments, for which they, not we, are
responsible.&nbsp; A stranger will not often enter our Abbey
without finding somewhere or other among its vast arcades,
skilled workmen busy over mosaic, marble, bronze, or
&lsquo;storied window richly dight;&rsquo; and the very
cloisters, which to Washington Irving&rsquo;s eye were
&lsquo;discoloured with damp, crumbling with age, and crusted
with a coat of hoary moss,&rsquo; are being repaired till that
&lsquo;rich tracery of the arches, and that leafy beauty of the
roses which adorn the keystones&rsquo;&mdash;of which he
tells&mdash;shall be as sharp and bright as they were first, 500
years ago.</p>
<p>One sentiment, again, which was called up in the mind of your
charming essayist, at the sight of Westminster Abbey, I have not
felt myself: I mean its sadness.&nbsp; &lsquo;What,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;is this vast assembly of <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>sepulchres
but a treasury of humiliation? a huge pile of reiterated homilies
on the emptiness of renown and the certainty of
oblivion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So does that &lsquo;mournful magnificence&rsquo; of which he
speaks, seem to have weighed on him, that he takes for the motto
of his whole essay, that grand Elizabethan epigram&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When I behold, with deep astonishment,<br />
To famous Westminster how there resort<br />
Living in brasse or stony monument,<br />
The Princes and the worthies of all sort;<br />
Do I not see re-formed nobilitie,<br />
Without contempt, or pride, or ostentation,<br />
And look upon offenseless majestie,<br />
Naked of pomp or earthly domination?<br />
And how a play-game of a painted stone<br />
Contents the quiet, now, and silent sprites,<br />
Whom all the world, which late they stood upon,<br />
Could not content, nor quench their appetites.<br />
Life is a frost of cold felicities;<br />
And death the thaw of all our vanities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True, true&mdash;who knows it not, who has lived fifty years
in such a world as this?&mdash;and yet but half the truth.</p>
<p>Were there no after-life, no juster home beyond the grave,
where each good deed&mdash;so spake the most august of
lips&mdash;shall in no wise lose its reward&mdash;is it nought,
<i>vir&ucirc;m volitare per ora</i>, to live upon the lips of
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>men, and find an immortality, even for a few centuries,
in their hearts?&nbsp; I know what answer healthy souls have made
in every age to that question; and what they will make to the
end, as long as the respect of their fellow-creatures is, as our
Creator meant that it should be, precious to virtuous men.&nbsp;
And let none talk of &lsquo;the play-game of a painted
stone,&rsquo; of &lsquo;the worthless honours of a
bust.&rsquo;&nbsp; The worth of honour lies in that same
worthlessness.&nbsp; Fair money wage for fair work done, no wise
man will despise.&nbsp; But that is pay, not honour; the very
preciousness whereof&mdash;like the old victor&rsquo;s parsley
crown in the Greek games&mdash;is that it had no value, gave no
pleasure, save that which is imperishable, spiritual, and not to
be represented by gold nor quintessential diamond.</p>
<p>Therefore, to me at least, the Abbey speaks, not of vanity and
disappointment, but of content and peace.</p>
<blockquote><p>The quiet now and silent sprites</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of whom old Christolero sings, they are content; and well for
them that they should be.&nbsp; They have received their
nation&rsquo;s thanks, and ask no more, save to lie there in
peace.&nbsp; They have had justice done them; and more than one
is there, who had scant justice done him while alive.&nbsp; Even
Castlereagh is there, in spite of Byron&rsquo;s and of
Shelley&rsquo;s scorn.&nbsp; It may be that they too have found
out ere now, that there he ought <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>to be.&nbsp;
The nation has been just to him who, in such wild times as the
world had not seen for full three hundred years, did his duty
according to his light, and died in doing it; and his sad noble
face looks down on Englishmen as they go by, not with reproach,
but rather with content.</p>
<p>Content, I say, and peace.&nbsp; Peace from their toil, and
peace with their fellow-men.&nbsp; They are at least at
rest.&nbsp; <i>Obdormierunt in pace</i>.&nbsp; They have fallen
asleep in peace.&nbsp; The galled shoulder is freed from the
collar at last.&nbsp; The brave old horse has done his stage and
lain down in the inn.&nbsp; There are no more mistakes now, no
more sores, no more falls; and no more whip, thank God, laid on
too often when it was least needed and most felt.</p>
<p>And there are no more quarrels, too.&nbsp; Old personal feuds,
old party bickerings, old differences of creed, and hatreds in
the name of the God of love&mdash;all those are past, in that
world of which the Abbey is to me a symbol and a sacrament.&nbsp;
Pitt and Fox, Warren Hastings and Macaulay, they can afford to be
near to each other in the Abbey; for they understand each other
now elsewhere; and the Romish Abbot&rsquo;s bones do not stir in
their grave beside the bones of the Protestant Divine whom he, it
may be, would have burned alive on earth.</p>
<p>In the south aisle of Henry the VIIth&rsquo;s Chapel lies in
royal pomp she who so long was Britain&rsquo;s <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>bane&mdash;&lsquo;the daughter of debate, who discord
still did sow&rsquo;&mdash;poor Mary Queen of Scots.&nbsp; But
English and Scots alike have forgotten the streams of noble blood
she cost their nations; and look sadly and pityingly upon her
effigy&mdash;why not?</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing is left of her<br />
Now but pure womanly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the corresponding aisle upon the north, in a like
tomb&mdash;which the voice of the English people demanded from
the son of Mary Stuart&mdash;lies even a sadder figure
still&mdash;poor Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; To her indeed, in her
last days, Vanity of vanities&mdash;all was vanity.&nbsp;
Tyrone&rsquo;s rebellion killed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;This fruit have
I of all my labours which I have taken under the
sun&rsquo;&mdash;and with a whole book of Ecclesiastes written on
her mighty heart, the old crowned lioness of England coiled
herself up in her lair, refused food, and died, and took her
place henceforth opposite to her &lsquo;dear cousin&rsquo; whom
she really tried to save from herself&mdash;who would have slain
her if she could, and whom she had at last, in obedience to the
voice of the people of England, to slay against her will.&nbsp;
They have made up that quarrel now.</p>
<p>Ay, and that tomb is the sacred symbol of a reconciliation
even more pathetic and more strange.&nbsp; Elizabeth
lies&mdash;seemingly by her own desire&mdash;in the same vault as
her own sister, Mary Tudor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bloody <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Mary,&rsquo;
now, no more.&nbsp; James the First, who had no love for either
of them, has placed at the head of the monument &lsquo;two
lines,&rsquo; as has been well said, &lsquo;full of a far deeper
feeling than we should naturally have ascribed to
him&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows in the kingdom, and in the tomb, Here we sleep;
Mary and Elizabeth the sisters; in hope of the
resurrection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I make no comment on those words; or on that double
sepulchre.&nbsp; But did I not say well, that the great Abbey was
a place of peace&mdash;a place to remind hardworked, purblind,
and often, alas! embittered souls&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For Mother Earth she gathers all<br />
Into her bosom, great and small.<br />
Ah! could we look into her face,<br />
We should not shrink from her embrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, all old misunderstandings are cleared up by now in that
just world wherein all live to God.&nbsp; They live to God; and
therefore the great Abbey is to me awful indeed, but never
sad.&nbsp; Awful it ought to be, for it is a symbol of both
worlds, the seen and the unseen; and of the veil, as thin as
cobweb, yet opaque as night, which parts the two.&nbsp; Awful it
is; and ought to be&mdash;like that with which it grew&mdash;the
life of a great nation, growing slowly to manhood, as all great
nations grow, through ignorance <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and
waywardness, often through sin and sorrow; hewing onward a
devious track through unknown wildernesses; and struggling,
victorious, though with bleeding feet, athwart the tangled woods
and thorny brakes of stern experience.</p>
<p>Awful it is; and should be.&nbsp; And, therefore, I at least
do not regret that its very form, outside, should want those
heaven-pointing spires, that delicate lightness, that airy
joyousness, of many a foreign cathedral&mdash;even of our own
Salisbury and Lichfield.&nbsp; You will see in its outer shape
little, if any, of that type of architecture which was, as I
believe, copied from scenery with which you, as Americans, must
be even more familiar than were the medi&aelig;val architects who
travelled through the German forests and across the Alps to
Rome.&nbsp; True, we have our noble high-pitched snow-roof.&nbsp;
Our architect, like the rest, had seen the mountain ranges jut
black and bare above the snows of winter.&nbsp; He had seen those
snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents from the sun,
off the steep slabs of rock which coped the hill-side; and he,
like the rest, has copied in that roof, for use as well as
beauty, the mountain rocks.</p>
<p>But he has not, as many another medi&aelig;val architect has
done, decked his roofs as Nature has decked hers, with the spruce
and fir-tree spires, which cling to the hill-side of the crag,
old above young, pinnacle above pinnacle, whorl above whorl; and
clothed with <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>them the sides and summit of the
stone mountain which he had raised, till, like a group of firs
upon an isolated rock, every point of the building should seem in
act to grow toward heaven, and the grey leads of the Minster roof
stand out amid peaks and turrets rich with carven foliage, as the
grey rocks stand out of the prim&aelig;val woods.</p>
<p>That part of the medi&aelig;val builder&rsquo;s task was left
unfinished, and indeed hardly attempted, by our Westminster
architects, either under Henry III., Edward I., or Henry V.</p>
<p>Their Minster is grand enough by grave height and severe
proportion; and he who enters stooping under that low-browed arch
of the north door, beneath the beetling crag of weatherworn and
crumbling stone, may feel like one who, in some old northern
fairy tale, enters a cave in some lone mountain side where trolls
and dragons guard the hoards of buried kings.</p>
<p>And awful it is, and should be still, inside; under that
vaulted roof a hundred feet above, all more mysterious and more
huge, and yet more soft, beneath the murky London air.</p>
<p>But sad I cannot call it.&nbsp; Nor, I think, would you feel
it sad, when you perceive how richly successive architects have
squandered on it the treasures of their fancy; and made it, so
they say, perhaps the most splendid specimen in the world of one
of those stone <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>forests, in which the men of old
delighted to reproduce those leafy minsters which God, not man,
has built; where they sent the columns aloft like the boles of
giant trees, and wreathed their capitals, sometimes their very
shafts, with vines and flowers; and decked with foliage and with
fruit the bosses above and the corbels below; and sent up out of
those corbels upright shafts along the walls, in likeness of the
trees which sprang out of the rocks above their head; and raised
those walls into great cliffs; and pierced those cliffs with the
arches of the triforium, as with wild creatures&rsquo; caves or
hermits&rsquo; cells; and represented in the horizontal
string-courses and window-sills the strata of the rocks; and
opened the windows into wide and lofty glades, broken, as in the
forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through which were
seen, not only the outer, but the upper world.&nbsp; For they
craved&mdash;as all true artists crave&mdash;for light and
colour; and had the sky above been one perpetual blue, they might
have been content with it, and left their glass
transparent.&nbsp; But in our dark dank northern clime, rain and
snowstorm, black cloud and grey mist, were all that they were
like to see outside for six months in the year.&nbsp; So they
took such light and colour as nature gave in her few gayer moods,
and set aloft in their stained glass windows the hues of the
noonday and of the sunset, and the purple of the heather, and the
gold of the gorse, and <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the azure of the bugloss, and the
crimson of the poppy; and among them, in gorgeous robes, the
angels and the saints of heaven, and the memories of heroic
virtues and heroic sufferings, that they might lift up the eyes
and hearts of men for ever out of the dark sad world of the cold
north, with all its coarsenesses and its crimes, towards a realm
of perpetual holiness, amid a perpetual summer of beauty and of
light: as one who, from between the black jaws of a narrow glen,
or from beneath the black shade of gigantic trees, catches a
glimpse of far lands gay with gardens and cottages; and purple
mountain ranges; and the far-off sea; and the hazy horizon
melting into the hazy sky; and finds his soul led forth into an
infinite, at once of freedom and repose.</p>
<p>Awful, and yet not sad; at least to one who is reminded by it,
even in its darkest winter&rsquo;s gloom, of the prim&aelig;val
tropic forest at its two most exquisite moments&mdash;its too
brief twilight, and its too swift dawn.</p>
<p>Awful, and yet not sad; at least to an Englishman, while right
and left are ranged the statues, the busts, the names, the deeds,
of men who have helped, each in his place, to make my country,
and your country too, that which they are.</p>
<p>For am I not in goodly company?&nbsp; Am I not in very deed
upon my best behaviour? among my betters? and at court?&nbsp;
Among men before whom I <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>should have been ashamed to say or do
a base or foolish thing?&nbsp; Among men who have taught me, have
ennobled me, though they lived centuries since?&nbsp; Men whom I
should have loved had I met them on earth?&nbsp; Men whom I may
meet yet, and tell them how I love them, in some other
world?&nbsp; Men, too, whom I might have hated, and who might
have hated me, had we met on this poor piecemeal earth; but whom
I may learn to regard with justice and with charity in the world
where all shall know, even as they are known?&nbsp; Men,
too&mdash;alas! how fast their number grows&mdash;whom I have
known, have loved, and lost too soon; and all gleaming out of the
gloom, as every image of the dead should do, in pure white
marble, as if purged from earthly taint?&nbsp; To them,
too&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing is left of them<br />
Now but pure manly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, while their monuments remind me that they are not dead,
but living&mdash;for all live to God&mdash;then awed I am, and
humbled; better so: but sad I cannot be in such grand
company.</p>
<p>I said, the men who helped to make my country, and yours
too.&nbsp; It would be an impertinence in me to remind most of
you of that.&nbsp; You know as well as I that you are represented
just as much as the English people, by every monument in that
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Abbey earlier than the Civil Wars, and by most monuments
of later date, especially by those of all our literary men.&nbsp;
You know that, and you value the old Abbey accordingly.&nbsp; But
a day may come&mdash;a generation may come, in a nation so
rapidly increasing by foreign immigration, as well as by
home-born citizenship&mdash;a generation may come who will forget
that fact; and orators arise who will be glad that it should be
forgotten&mdash;for awhile.&nbsp; But if you would not that that
evil day should come then teach your children&mdash;That the
history and the freedom of America began neither with the War of
Independence, nor with the sailing of the Pilgrim Fathers, nor
with the settlement of Virginia; but 1500 years and more before,
in the days when our common Teutonic ancestors, as free then as
this day, knew how</p>
<blockquote><p>In den Deutschen Forsten<br />
Wie der Aar zu horsten,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when Herman smote the Romans in the Teutoburger-Wald, and the
great C&aelig;sar wailed in vain to his slain general,
&lsquo;Varus, give me back my legions!&rsquo;&nbsp; Teach your
children that the Congress which sits at Washington is as much
the child of Magna Charta as the Parliament which sits at
Westminster; and that when you resisted the unjust demands of an
English king and council, you did but that which the <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>free
commons of England held the right to do, and did, not only after,
but before, the temporary tyranny of the Norman kings.</p>
<p>Show them the tombs of English kings; not of those Norman
kings&mdash;no Norman king lies buried in our Abbey&mdash;there
is no royal interment between Edward the Confessor, the last
English prince of Cerdic&rsquo;s house, and Henry the Third, the
first of the new English line of kings.&nbsp; Tell them, in
justice to our common forefathers, that those men were no
tyrants, but <i>kings</i>, who swore to keep, and for the most
part did keep, like loyal gentlemen, the ancient English laws,
which they had sworn in Westminster Abbey to maintain; and that
the few of them who persisted in outraging the rights or the
conscience of the free people of England, paid for their perjury
with their crowns, or with their lives.&nbsp; And tell them, too,
in justice to our common ancestors, that there were never wanting
to the kings, the nobles, or the commons of England, since the
days when Simon de Montfort organised the House of Commons in
Westminster Hall, on the 2nd of May, 1258&mdash;there were never
wanting, I say, to the kings, the nobles, or the commons of
England, counsellors who dared speak the truth and defend the
right, even at the risk of their own goods and their own
lives.</p>
<p>Remind them, too&mdash;or let our monuments remind <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>them&mdash;that even in the worst times of the War of
Independence, there were not wanting, here in England, statesmen
who dared to speak out for justice and humanity; and that they
were not only confessed to be the leading men of their own day,
but the very men whom England delighted to honour by places in
her Pantheon.&nbsp; Show them the monuments of Chatham, Pitt, and
Fox&mdash;Burke sleeps in peace elsewhere&mdash;and remind them
that the great earl, who literally died as much in your service
as in ours, whose fiery invectives against the cruelties of that
old war are, I am proud to say, still common-places for
declamation among our English schoolboys, dared, even when all
was at the worst, to tell the English House of
Lords&mdash;&lsquo;If I were an American, as I am an Englishman,
while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay
down my arms&mdash;never, never, never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;an American as well as an Englishman may find
himself in the old Abbey in right good company.</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;and I do not hesitate to say, that if you will look
through the monuments erected in that Abbey, since those of Pitt
and Fox&mdash;you will find that the great majority commemorate
the children, not of obstruction, but of progress; not of
darkness, but of light.</p>
<p>Holland, Tierney, Mackintosh, Grattan, Peel, Canning,
Palmerston, Isaac Watts, Bell, Wilberforce, Sharp, the Macaulays,
Fowell Buxton, Francis Horner, <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Charles
Buller, Cobden, Watt, Rennell, Telford, Locke, Brunel, Grote,
Thackeray, Dickens, Maurice&mdash;men who, each in his own way,
toiled for freedom of some kind; freedom of race, of laws, of
commerce, of locomotion, of production, of speech, of thought, of
education, of human charity, and of sympathy&mdash;these are the
men whom England still delights to honour; whose busts around our
walls show that the ancient spirit is not dead, and that we, as
you, are still, as 1500 years ago, the sons of freedom and of
light.</p>
<p>But, beside these statesmen who were just and true to you, and
therefore to their native land, there lie men before whose
monuments I would ask thoughtful Americans to pause&mdash;I mean
those of our old fighters, by land and sea.&nbsp; I do not speak
merely of those who lived before our Civil Wars, though they are
indeed our common heritage.&nbsp; And when you look at the noble
monuments of De Vere and Norris, the fathers of the English
infantry, you should remember that your ancestors and mine, or
that of any other Englishman, may have trailed pike and handled
sword side by side under those very men, in those old wars of the
Netherlands, which your own great historian, Mr. Motley, has so
well described; or have sailed together to Cadiz fight, and to
the Spanish Main, with Raleigh or with Drake.</p>
<p>There are those, again, who did their duty two and three
generations later&mdash;though one of the noblest of <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>them
all, old Admiral Blake, alas! lies we know not where&mdash;cast
out, with Cromwell and his heroes, by the fanatics and sycophants
of the Restoration&mdash;whom not only we, but Royalty itself,
would now restore, could we recover their noble ashes, to their
rightful resting-place.</p>
<p>And these, if not always our common ancestors, were, often
enough, our common cousins, as in the case of my own family, in
which one brother was settling in New England, to found there a
whole new family of Kingsleys while the other brother was
fighting in the Parliamentary army, and helping to defeat Charles
at Rowton Moor.</p>
<p>But there is another class of warriors&rsquo; tombs, which I
ask you, if ever you visit the Abbey, to look on with respect,
and let me say, affection too.&nbsp; I mean the men who did their
duty, by land and sea, in that long series of wars which,
commencing in 1739, ended in 1783, with our recognition of your
right and power to be a free and independent people.&nbsp; Of
those who fought against you I say nought.&nbsp; But I must speak
of those who fought for you&mdash;who brought to naught, by sheer
hard blows, that family compact of the House of Bourbon, which
would have been as dangerous to you upon this side of the ocean
as to us upon the other; who smote with a continual stroke the
trans-Atlantic power of Spain, till they placed her once vast and
rich possessions at your mercy to <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>this day; and
who&mdash;even more important still&mdash;prevented the French
from seizing at last the whole valley of the Mississippi, and
girdling your nascent dominion with a hostile frontier, from
Louisiana round to the mouth of the St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>When you see Wolfe&rsquo;s huge cenotaph, with its curious
bronze bas-relief of the taking of the heights of Abraham, think,
I pray you, that not only for England, but for you, the
&lsquo;little red-haired corporal&rsquo; conquered and died.</p>
<p>Remember, too, that while your ancestors were fighting well by
land, and Washington and such as he were learning their lesson at
Fort Duquesne and elsewhere better than we could teach them, we
were fighting well where we knew how to fight&mdash;at sea.&nbsp;
And when, near to Wolfe&rsquo;s monument, or in the Nave, you see
such names as Cornwallis, Saumarez, Wager, Vernon&mdash;the
conqueror of Portobello&mdash;Lord Aubrey Beauclerk, and so
forth&mdash;bethink you that every French or Spanish ship which
these men took, and every convoy they cut off, from Toulon to
Carthagena, and from Carthagena to Halifax, made more and more
possible the safe severance from England of the very Colonies
which you were then helping us to defend.&nbsp; And then agree,
like the generous-hearted people which you are, that if, in after
years, we sinned against you&mdash;and how heavy were our sins, I
know too well&mdash;there was a time, before those evil days,
when <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>we fought for you, and by your side, as the old lion by
the young; even though, like the old lion and the young, we
began, only too soon, tearing each other to pieces over the
division of the prey.</p>
<p>Nay, I will go further, and say this, paradoxical as it may
seem:&mdash;When you enter the North Transept from St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Churchyard you see on your right hand a huge but
not ungraceful naval monument of white marble, inscribed with the
names of Bayne, Blair, Lord Robert Manners&mdash;three commanders
of Rodney&rsquo;s, in the crowning victory of April 12,
1782&mdash;fought upon Tropic waters, over which I have sailed,
flushed with the thought that my own grandfather was that day on
board of Rodney&rsquo;s ship.</p>
<p>Now do you all know what that day&rsquo;s great fight meant
for you,&mdash;fought though it was, while you, alas! were still
at war with us?&nbsp; It meant this.&nbsp; That that
day&mdash;followed up, six months after, by Lord Howe&rsquo;s
relief of Gibraltar&mdash;settled, I hold, the fate of the New
World for many a year.&nbsp; True, in one sense, it was settled
already.&nbsp; Cornwallis had already capitulated at York
Town.&nbsp; But even then the old lion, disgraced, bleeding,
fainting, ready to yield&mdash;but only to you, of his own kin
and blood&mdash;struck, though with failing paw, two such
tremendous blows at his old enemies, as deprived them thenceforth
of any real power in the New World; precipitated that bankruptcy
and ruin which issued in the French and <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Spanish
revolutions; and made certain, as I believe, the coming day when
the Anglo-Saxon race shall be the real masters of the whole New
World.</p>
<p>Of poets and of men of letters I say nought.&nbsp; They are
the heritage, neither of us, nor you, but of the human
race.&nbsp; The mere man of letters may well sleep in the very
centre of that busy civilisation from which he drew his
inspiration: but not the poet&mdash;not, at least, the poet of
these days.&nbsp; He goes not to the town, but nature, for his
inspirations, and to nature when he dies he should return.&nbsp;
Such men&mdash;artificial, and town-bred&mdash;however brilliant,
or even grand at times&mdash;as Davenant, Dryden, Cowley,
Congreve, Prior, Gay&mdash;sleep fitly in our care here.&nbsp;
Yet even Pope&mdash;though one of such in style and
heart&mdash;preferred the parish church of the then rural
Twickenham, and Gray the lonely graveyard of Stoke Pogis.&nbsp;
Ben Jonson has a right to lie with us.&nbsp; He was a townsman to
the very heart, and a court-poet too.&nbsp; But Chaucer, Spenser,
Drayton&mdash;such are, to my mind, out of place.&nbsp; Chaucer
lies here, because he lived hard by.&nbsp; Spenser through bitter
need and woe.&nbsp; But I should have rather buried Chaucer in
some trim garden, Spenser beneath the forest aisles, and Drayton
by some silver stream&mdash;each man&rsquo;s dust resting where
his heart was set.&nbsp; Happier, it seems to me, are those who
like Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Southey, Scott and Burns, lie
far away, in scenes <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>they knew and loved; fulfilling
Burke&rsquo;s wise choice: &lsquo;After all I had sooner sleep in
the southern corner of a country churchyard than in the tomb of
all the Capulets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;these worthies, one and all, are a token that the
Great Abbey, and all its memories of 800 years, does not belong
to us alone, nor even to the British Empire alone and all its
Colonies, but to America likewise!&nbsp; That when an American
enters beneath that mighty shade, he treads on common and
ancestral ground, as sacred to him as it is to us; the symbol of
common descent, common development, common speech, common creed,
common laws, common literature, common national interests, and I
trust, of a common respect and affection, such as the wise can
only feel toward the wise, and the strong toward the strong.</p>
<p>Is all this sentiment?&nbsp; Remember what I said just now: by
well-used sentiment, and well-used sorrow, great nations
live.</p>

32</span>LECTURE II.<br />
THE STAGE AS IT WAS ONCE.</h2>
<p>What the Stage is now, I presume, all know.&nbsp; I am not
myself a playgoer, but I am informed that, in Europe at least, it
is not in a state to arouse any deep interest or respect in any
cultivated or virtuous person.&nbsp; Meanwhile, keeping fast to
my intention of talking to you only about things worthy of your
interest and respect, because they are good, true, and beautiful,
I wish to tell you what the Stage was once, in a republic of the
past&mdash;what it may be again, I sometimes dream, in some
republic of the future.</p>
<p>Let me take you back in fancy some 2314 years&mdash;440 years
before the Christian era, and try to sketch for you&mdash;alas!
how clumsily&mdash;a great, though tiny people, in one of their
greatest moments&mdash;in one of the greatest moments, it may be,
of the human race.&nbsp; For surely it is a great and a rare
moment for humanity, when all that is loftiest in it&mdash;when
reverence for the Unseen powers, reverence for the heroic dead,
reverence for the father-land; and that reverence, <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>too,
for self, which is expressed in stateliness and self-restraint,
in grace and courtesy; when all these, I say, can lend
themselves, even for a day, to the richest enjoyment of
life&mdash;to the enjoyment of beauty in form and sound, and of
relaxation, not brutalizing, but ennobling.</p>
<p>Rare, alas! have such seasons been in the history of poor
humanity.&nbsp; But when they have come, they have lifted it up
one stage higher thenceforth.&nbsp; Men, having been such once,
may become such again; and the work which such times have left
behind them becomes immortal.</p>
<blockquote><p>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me take you to the then still unfinished theatre of
Athens, hewn out of the limestone rock on the south-east slope of
the Acropolis.</p>
<p>Above are the new marble buildings of the Parthenon, rich with
the statues and bas-reliefs of Phidias and his scholars, gleaming
white against the blue sky, with the huge bronze statue of
Athen&eacute; Promachos, fifty feet in height, towering up among
the temples and colonnades.&nbsp; In front, and far below, gleams
the blue sea, and Salamis beyond.</p>
<p>And there are gathered the people of Athens&mdash;50,000 of
them, possibly, when the theatre was complete and full.&nbsp; If
it be fine, they all wear garlands <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>on their
heads.&nbsp; If the sun be too hot, they wear wide-brimmed straw
hats.&nbsp; And if a storm comes on, they will take refuge in the
porticos beneath; not without wine and cakes, for what they have
come to see will last for many an hour, and they intend to feast
their eyes and ears from sunrise to sunset.&nbsp; On the highest
seats are slaves and freedmen, below them the free citizens; and
on the lowest seats of all are the dignitaries of the
republic&mdash;the priests, the magistrates, and the other
&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&#8054;
&chi;&#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&omicron;&#8054;&mdash;the fair
and good men&mdash;as the citizens of the highest rank were
called, and with them foreign ambassadors and distinguished
strangers.&nbsp; What an audience&mdash;the rapidest, subtlest,
wittiest, down to the very cobblers and tinkers, the world has
ever seen.&nbsp; And what noble figures on those front seats;
Pericles, with Aspasia beside him, and all his
friends&mdash;Anaxagoras the sage, Phidias the sculptor, and many
another immortal artist; and somewhere among the free citizens,
perhaps beside his father Sophroniscus the sculptor, a short,
square, pugnosed boy of ten years old, looking at it all with
strange eyes&mdash;&lsquo;who will be one day,&rsquo; so said the
Pythoness at Delphi, &lsquo;the wisest man in
Greece&rsquo;&mdash;sage, metaphysician, humourist, warrior,
patriot, martyr&mdash;for his name is <i>Socrates</i>.</p>
<p>All are in their dresses of office; for this is not merely a
day of amusement, but of religious ceremony; sacred to
Dionysos&mdash;Bacchus, the inspiring <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>god, who
raises men above themselves, for good&mdash;or for evil.</p>
<p>The evil, or at least the mere animal aspect of that
inspiration, was to be seen in forms grotesque and sensuous
enough in those very festivals, when the gayer and coarser part
of the population, in town and country, broke out into frantic
masquerade, of which that silly carnival of Rome is perhaps the
last paltry and unmeaning relic.&nbsp; &lsquo;When,&rsquo; as the
learned O. M&uuml;ller says, &lsquo;the desire of escaping from
self into something new and strange, of living in an imaginary
world, broke forth in a thousand ways; not merely in revelry and
solemn, though fantastic songs, but in a hundred disguises,
imitating the subordinate beings&mdash;satyrs, pans, and nymphs,
by whom the god was surrounded, and through whom life seemed to
pass from him into vegetation, and branch off into a variety of
beautiful or grotesque forms&mdash;beings who were ever present
to the fancy of the Greeks, as a convenient step by which they
could approach more nearly to the presence of the
Divinity.&rsquo;&nbsp; But even out of that seemingly bare chaos,
Athenian genius was learning how to construct, under Eupolis,
Cratinus and Aristophanes, that elder school of comedy, which
remains not only unsurpassed, but unapproachable, save by
Rabelais alone, as the ideal cloudland of masquerading wisdom, in
which the whole universe goes mad&mdash;but with a subtle method
in its madness.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Yes, so it has been, under some form or other, in every
race and clime&mdash;ever since Eve ate of the magic fruit, that
she might be as a god, knowing good and evil, and found, poor
thing, as most have since, that it was far easier and more
pleasant to know the evil than to know the good.&nbsp; But that
theatre was built that men might know therein the good as well as
the evil.&nbsp; To learn the evil, indeed, according to their
light, and the sure vengeance of At&eacute; and the Furies which
tracks up the evil-doer.&nbsp; But to learn also the
good&mdash;lessons of piety, patriotism, heroism, justice, mercy,
self-sacrifice, and all that comes out of the hearts of men and
women not dragged <i>below</i>, but raised <i>above</i>
themselves; and behind all&mdash;at least in the nobler and
earlier tragedies of &AElig;schylus and Sophocles, before
Euripides had introduced the tragedy of mere human passion; that
sensation tragedy, which is the only one the world knows now, and
of which the world is growing rapidly tired&mdash;behind all, I
say, lessons of the awful and unfathomable mystery of human
existence, of unseen destiny; of that seemingly capricious
distribution of weal and woe, to which we can find no solution on
this side the grave, for which the old Greek could find no
solution whatsoever.</p>
<p>Therefore there was a central object in the old Greek theatre,
most important to it, but which does not exist in our theatres,
and did not in the old <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Roman; because our tragedies, like
the Roman, are mere plays concerning love, murder, and so forth,
while the Greek were concerning the deepest relations of man to
the Unseen.</p>
<p>The almost circular orchestra, or pit, between the benches and
the stage, was empty of what we call spectators&mdash;because it
was destined for the true and ideal spectators&mdash;the
representatives of humanity; in its centre was a round platform,
the &theta;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mdash;originally
the altar of Bacchus&mdash;from which the leader of these
representatives, the leader of the Chorus, could converse with
the actors on the stage and take his part in the drama; and round
this thymel&eacute; the Chorus ranged, with measured dance and
song, chanting, to the sound of a simple flute, odes such as the
world had never heard before or since, save perhaps in the
temple-worship at Jerusalem.&nbsp; A chorus now, as you know,
means merely any number of persons singing in full harmony on any
subject.&nbsp; The Chorus was then in tragedy, and indeed in the
higher comedy, what Schlegel well calls &lsquo;the ideal
spectator,&rsquo;&mdash;a personified reflection on the action
going on, the incorporation into the representation itself of the
sentiments of the poet, as the spokesman of the whole human
race.&nbsp; He goes on to say (and I think truly), &lsquo;that
the Chorus always retained among the Greeks a peculiar national
signification, publicity being, according to <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>their
republican notions, essential to the completeness of every
important transaction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus the Chorus represented
idealised public opinion: not of course, the shifting, hasty
public opinion of the moment&mdash;to that it was a conservative
check, and it calmed to soberness and charity&mdash;for it was
the matured public opinion of centuries; the experience, and
usually the sad experience, of many generations; the very spirit
of the Greek race.</p>
<p>The Chorus might be composed of what the poet would.&nbsp; Of
ancient citizens, waiting for their sons to come back from the
war, as in the <i>Agamemnon</i> of &AElig;schylus; of sea-nymphs,
as in his <i>Prometheus Bound</i>; even of the very Furies who
hunt the matricide, as in his <i>Eumenides</i>; of Senators as in
the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles; or of village farmers as in his
<i>&OElig;dipus at Colonos</i>&mdash;and now I have named five of
the greatest poems, as I hold, written by mortal man till Dante
rose.&nbsp; Or it may be the Chorus was composed&mdash;as in the
comedies of Aristophanes, the greatest humourist the world has
ever seen&mdash;of birds, or of frogs, or even of clouds.&nbsp;
It may rise to the level of Don Quixote, or sink to that of
Sancho Panza; for it is always the incarnation of such wisdom,
heavenly or earthly, as the poet wishes the people to bring to
bear on the subject-matter!</p>
<p>But let the poets themselves, rather than me, speak
awhile.&nbsp; Allow me to give you a few specimens of <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>these
choruses&mdash;the first as an example of that practical, and yet
surely not un-divine wisdom, by which they supplied the place of
our modern preacher, or essayist, or didactic poet.</p>
<p>Listen to this of the old men&rsquo;s chorus in the
<i>Agamemnon</i>, in the spirited translation of my friend
Professor Blackie:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas said of old, and
&rsquo;tis said to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wealth to prosperous stature grown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begets a birth of its own:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a surfeit of evil by good is prepared,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sons must bear what allotment of woe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sires were spared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But this I refuse to believe: I know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That impious deeds conspire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To beget an offspring of impious deeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too like their ugly sire.<br />
But whoso is just, though his wealth like a river<br />
Flow down, shall be scathless: his house shall rejoice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In an offspring of beauty for ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the haughty delights to
beget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A haughty heart.&nbsp; From time to time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In children&rsquo;s children recurrent appears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancestral crime.<br />
When the dark hour comes that the gods have decreed<br />
And the Fury burns with wrathful fires,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A demon unholy, with ire unabated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies like black night on the halls of the fated;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the recreant Son plunges guiltily on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To perfect the guilt of his
Sires.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>But Justice shines in a lowly cell;<br />
In the homes of poverty, smoke-begrimed,<br />
With the sober-minded she loves to dwell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But she turns aside<br />
From the rich man&rsquo;s house with averted eye,<br />
The golden-fretted halls of pride<br />
Where hands with lucre are foul, and the praise<br />
Of counterfeit goodness smoothly sways;<br />
And wisely she guides in the strong man&rsquo;s despite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All things to an issue of <span
class="smcap">right</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me now give you another passage from the
<i>Eumenides</i>&mdash;or <i>Furies</i>, of &AElig;schylus.</p>
<p>Orestes, prince of Argos, you must remember, has avenged on
his mother Clytemnestra the murder of his father, king Agamemnon,
on his return from Troy.&nbsp; Pursued by the Furies, he takes
refuge in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and then, still
Fury-haunted, goes to Athens, where Pallas Athen&eacute; the
warrior-maiden, the tutelary goddess of Athens, bids him refer
his cause to the Areopagus, the highest court of Athens, Apollo
acting as his advocate, and she sitting as umpire in the
midst.&nbsp; The white and black balls are thrown into the urn,
and are equal; and Orestes is only delivered by the decision of
Athen&eacute;&mdash;as the representative of the nearer race of
gods, the Olympians, the friends of man, in whose likeness man is
made.&nbsp; The Furies are the representatives of the older and
darker creed&mdash;which yet has a depth of <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>truth in
it&mdash;of the irreversible dooms which underlie all nature; and
which represent the <i>Law</i>, and not the Gospel, the
consequence of the mere act, independent of the spirit which has
prompted it.</p>
<p>They break out in fury against the overbearing arrogance of
these younger gods.&nbsp; Athen&eacute; bears their rage with
equanimity, addresses them in the language of kindness, even of
veneration, till these so indomitable beings are unable to
withstand the charm of her mild eloquence.&nbsp; They are to have
a sanctuary in the Athenian land, and to be called no more Furies
(Erinnys), but Eumenides&mdash;the
<i>well-conditioned</i>&mdash;the kindly goddesses.&nbsp; And all
ends with a solemn procession round the orchestra, with hymns of
blessing, while the terrible Chorus of the Furies, clothed in
black, with blood-stained girdles, and serpents in their hair, in
masks having perhaps somewhat of the terrific beauty of
Medusa-masks, are convoyed to their new sanctuary by a procession
of children, women, and old men in purple robes and torches in
their hands, after Athen&eacute; and the Furies have sung, in
response to each other, a chorus from which I must beg leave to
give you an extract or two.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Eldest Fury</i>
(<i>Leader of the Chorus</i>).</p>
<p>Far from thy dwelling, and far from thy border,<br />
By the grace of my godhead benignant I order<br />
The blight which may blacken the bloom of the trees.<br />
Far from thy border, and far from thy dwelling,<br />
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

swelling,<br />
The seed-rotting taint, and the creeping disease.<br />
Thy flocks be still doubled, thy seasons be steady,<br />
And when Hermes is near thee, thy hand be still ready<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heaven-dropt bounty to seize.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Athen&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Hear her words, my city&rsquo;s warders&mdash;<br />
Fraught with blessings, she prevaileth<br />
With Olympians and Infernals,<br />
Dread Erinnys much revered.<br />
Mortal faith she guideth plainly<br />
To what goal she pleaseth, sending<br />
Songs to some, to others days<br />
With tearful sorrows dulled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Furies</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from thy border<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawless disorder<br />
That sateless of evil shall reign;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from thy dwelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dear blood welling,<br />
That taints thine own hearth with the slain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When slaughter from slaughter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall flow like the water,<br />
And rancour from rancour shall grow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But joy with joy blending,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Live, each to all lending;<br />
And hating one-hearted the foe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When bliss hath departed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From love single-hearted,<br />
A fountain of healing shall flow.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Those of you here who love your country as well as the old
Athenians loved theirs, will feel at once the grand political
significance of such a scene, in which patriotism and religion
become one&mdash;and feel, too, the exquisite dramatic effect of
the innocent, the weak, the unwarlike, welcoming among them,
without fear, because without guilt, those ancient snaky-haired
sisters, emblems of all that is most terrible and most
inscrutable, in the destiny of nations, of families, and of
men:</p>
<blockquote><p>To their hallowed habitations<br />
&rsquo;Neath Ogygian earth&rsquo;s foundations<br />
In that darksome hall<br />
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Sacrifice and supplication<br />
Shall not fail.&nbsp; In adoration<br />
Silent worship all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listen again, to the gentler patriotism of a gentler poet,
Sophocles himself.&nbsp; The village of Colonos, a mile from
Athens, was his birthplace; and in his <i>&OElig;dipus
Coloneus</i>, he makes his Chorus of village officials sing thus
of their consecrated olive grove:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good hap, stranger, to these
rural seats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou comest, to this region&rsquo;s blest
retreats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where white Colonos lifts his head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glories in the bounding steed.<br />
Where sadly sweet the frequent nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Impassioned pours his evening song,<br />
And charms with varied notes each verdant vale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ivy&rsquo;s dark-green boughs among,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sheltered &rsquo;neath the clustering vine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, high above him form a bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe from the sun or stormy shower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where frolic Bacchus often roves,<br />
And visits with his fostering nymphs the groves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathed in the dew of heaven each morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh is the fair Narcissus born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those great gods the crown of old;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The crocus glitters, robed in gold.<br />
Here restless fountains ever murmuring glide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And as their crisp&egrave;d streamlets play,<br />
To feed, Cephisus, thine unfailing tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh verdure marks their winding way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here oft to raise the tuneful song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The virgin band of Muses deigns,<br />
And car-borne Aphrodite guides her golden reins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Then they go on, this band of village elders, to praise
the gods for their special gifts to that small Athenian
land.&nbsp; They praise Pallas Athen&eacute;, who gave their
forefathers the olive; then Poseidon&mdash;Neptune, as the Romans
call him&mdash;who gave their forefathers the horse; and
something more&mdash;the ship,&mdash;the horse of the sea, as
they, like the old Norse Vikings after them, delighted to call
it.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our highest vaunt is this&mdash;Thy grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poseidon, we behold.<br />
The ruling curb, embossed with gold,<br />
Controls the courser&rsquo;s managed pace.<br />
Though loud, oh king, thy billows roar,<br />
Our strong hands grasp the labouring oar,<br />
And while the Nereids round it play,<br />
Light cuts our bounding bark its way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a combination of fine humanities!&nbsp; Dance and song,
patriotism and religion, so often parted among us, have flowed
together into one in these stately villagers; each a small
farmer; each a trained soldier, and probably a trained seaman
also; each a self-governed citizen; and each a cultured
gentleman, if ever there were gentlemen on earth.</p>
<p>But what drama, doing, or action&mdash;for such is the meaning
of the word&mdash;is going on upon the stage, to be commented on
by the sympathizing Chorus?</p>
<p>One drama, at least, was acted in Athens in that
year&mdash;440 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;which you, I
doubt not, know well&mdash;<!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>that
<i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles, which Mendelssohn has resuscitated,
in our own generation, by setting it to music, divine indeed,
though very different from the music to which it was set,
probably by Sophocles himself, at its first, and for ought we
know, its only representation.&nbsp; For pieces had not then, as
now, a run of a hundred nights and more.&nbsp; The Athenian
genius was so fertile, and the Athenian audience so eager for
novelty, that new pieces were demanded, and were forthcoming, for
each of the great festivals, and if a piece was represented a
second time it was usually after an interval of some years.&nbsp;
They did not, moreover, like the moderns, run every night to some
theatre or other, as a part of the day&rsquo;s amusement.&nbsp;
Tragedy, and even comedy, were serious subjects, calling out, not
a passing sigh, or passing laugh, but all the higher faculties
and emotions.&nbsp; And as serious subjects were to be expressed
in verse and music, which gave stateliness, doubtless, even to
the richest burlesques of Aristophanes, and lifted them out of
mere street-buffoonery into an ideal fairy land of the grotesque,
how much more stateliness must verse and music have added to
their tragedy!&nbsp; And how much have we lost, toward a true
appreciation of their dramatic art, by losing almost utterly not
only the laws of their melody and harmony, but even the true
metric time of their odes! music and metre, which must have
surely been as noble as their poetry, their sculpture, their
architecture, <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>possessed by the same exquisite sense
of form and of proportion.&nbsp; One thing we can
understand&mdash;how this musical form of the drama, which still
remains to us in lower shapes, in the oratorio, in the opera,
must have helped to raise their tragedies into that ideal sphere
in which they all, like the <i>Antigone</i>, live and move.&nbsp;
So ideal and yet so human; nay rather, truly ideal, because truly
human.&nbsp; The gods, the heroes, the kings, the princesses of
Greek tragedy were dear to the hearts of Greek republicans, not
merely as the founders of their states, not merely as the
tutelary deities, many of them, of their country: but as men and
women like themselves, only more vast; with mightier wills,
mightier virtues, mightier sorrows, and often mightier crimes;
their inward free-will battling, as Schlegel has well seen,
against outward circumstance and overruling fate, as every man
should battle, unless he sink to be a brute.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
tragedy,&rsquo; says Schlegel&mdash;uttering thus a deep and
momentous truth&mdash;&lsquo;the gods themselves either come
forward as the servants of destiny and mediate executors of its
decrees, or approve themselves godlike only by asserting their
liberty of action and entering upon the same struggles with fate
which man himself has to encounter.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I believe
this, that this Greek tragedy, with its godlike men and manlike
gods, and heroes who had become gods by the very vastness of
their humanity, was a preparation, and it may be a necessary
preparation, <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>for the true Christian faith in a Son
of man, who is at once utterly human and utterly divine.&nbsp;
Man is made in the likeness of God&mdash;is the root-idea, only
half-conscious, only half-expressed, but instinctive, without
which neither the Greek Tragedies, nor the Homeric Poems, six
hundred years before them, could have been composed.&nbsp;
Doubtless the idea that man was like a god degenerated too often
into the idea that the gods were like men, and as wicked.&nbsp;
But that travestie of a great truth is not confined to those old
Greeks.&nbsp; Some so-called Christian theories&mdash;as I
hold&mdash;have sinned in that direction as deeply as the
Athenians of old.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I say, that this long acquiescence in the
conception of godlike struggle, godlike daring, godlike
suffering, godlike martyrdom; the very conception which was so
foreign to the mythologies of any other race&mdash;save that of
the Jews, and perhaps of our own Teutonic forefathers&mdash;did
prepare, must have prepared, men to receive as most rational and
probable, as the satisfaction of their highest instincts, the
idea of a Being in whom all those partial rays culminated in
clear, pure light; of a Being at once utterly human and utterly
divine; who by struggle, suffering, self-sacrifice, without a
parallel, achieved a victory over circumstance and all the dark
powers which beleaguer man without a parallel likewise.</p>
<p>Take, as an example, the figure which you know <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>best&mdash;the figure of Antigone herself&mdash;devoting
herself to be entombed alone, for the sake of love and
duty.&nbsp; Love of a brother, which she can only prove, alas! by
burying his corpse.&nbsp; Duty to the dead, an instinct depending
on no written law, but springing out of the very depths of those
blind and yet sacred monitions which prove that the true man is
not an animal, but a spirit; fulfilling her holy purpose,
unchecked by fear, unswayed by her sisters&rsquo;
entreaties.&nbsp; Hardening her heart magnificently till her fate
is sealed; and then after proving her godlike courage, proving
the tenderness of her womanhood by that melodious wail over her
own untimely death and the loss of marriage joys, which some of
you must know from the music of Mendelssohn, and which the late
Dean Milman has put into English thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Come, fellow-citizens, and see<br />
The desolate Antigone.<br />
On the last path her steps shall tread,<br />
Set forth, the journey of the dead,<br />
Watching, with vainly lingering gaze,<br />
Her last, last sun&rsquo;s expiring rays,</p>
<p>Never to see it, never more,<br />
For down to Acheron&rsquo;s dread shore,<br />
A living victim am I led<br />
To Hades&rsquo; universal bed.<br />
To my dark lot no bridal joys<br />
Belong, nor e&rsquo;er the jocund noise<br />
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Of hymeneal chant shall sound for me,<br />
But death, cold death, my only spouse shall be.</p>
<p>Oh tomb!&nbsp; Oh bridal chamber!&nbsp; Oh deep-delved<br />
And strongly-guarded mansion!&nbsp; I descend<br />
To meet in your dread chambers all my kindred,<br />
Who in dark multitudes have crowded down<br />
Where Proserpine received the dead.&nbsp; But I,<br />
The last, and oh how few more miserable,<br />
Go down, or ere my sands of life are run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And let me ask you whether the contemplation of such a
self-sacrifice should draw you, should have drawn those who heard
the tale nearer to, or further from, a certain cross which stood
on Calvary some 1800 years ago?&nbsp; May not the tale of
Antigone heard from mother or from nurse have nerved ere now some
martyr-maiden to dare and suffer in an even holier cause?</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; This set purpose of the Athenian
dramatists of the best school to set before men a magnified
humanity, explains much in their dramas which seem to us at first
not only strange but faulty.&nbsp; The masks which gave one grand
but unvarying type of countenance to each well-known historic
personage, and thus excluded the play of feature, animated
gesture, and almost all which we now consider as
&lsquo;acting&rsquo; proper; the thicksoled cothurni which gave
the actor a more than human stature; the poverty (according to
our notions) of the scenery, which usually represented <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>merely the front of a palace or other public place, and
was often though not always unchanged during the whole
performance; the total absence in fact, of anything like that
scenic illusion which most managers of theatres seem now to
consider as their highest achievement; the small number of the
actors, two, or at most three only, being present on the stage at
once,&mdash;the simplicity of the action, in which intrigue (in
the play-house sense) and any complication of plot are utterly
absent; all this must have concentrated not the eye of the
spectator on the scene, but his ear upon the voice, and his
emotions on the personages who stood out before him without a
background, sharp-cut and clear as a group of statuary which is
the same, place it where you will, complete in itself&mdash;a
world of beauty, independent of all other things and beings save
on the ground on which it needs must stand.&nbsp; It was the
personage rather than his surroundings, which was to be impressed
by every word on the spectator&rsquo;s heart and intellect; and
the very essence of Greek tragedy is expressed in the still
famous words of Medea&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Che resta?&nbsp; Io.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast this with the European drama&mdash;especially with
the highest form of it&mdash;our own Elizabethan.&nbsp; It
resembles, as has been often said in better words than mine, not
statuary but painting.&nbsp; These dramas affect <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>colour, light, and shadow, background whether of town or
country, description of scenery where scenic machinery is
inadequate, all in fact, which can blend the action and the
actors with the surrounding circumstances, without letting them
altogether melt into the circumstances; which can show them a
part of the great whole, by harmony or discord with the whole
universe, down to the flowers beneath their feet.&nbsp; This,
too, had to be done: how it became possible for even the genius
of a Shakespeare to get it done, I may with your leave hint to
you hereafter.&nbsp; Why it was not given to the Greeks to do it,
I know not.</p>
<p>Let us at least thank them for what they did.&nbsp; One work
was given them, and that one they fulfilled as it had never been
fulfilled before; as it will never need to be fulfilled again;
for the Greeks&rsquo; work was done not for themselves alone but
for all races in all times; and Greek Art is the heirloom of the
whole human race; and that work was to assert in drama, lyric,
sculpture, music, gymnastic, the dignity of man&mdash;the dignity
of man which they perceived for the most part with their intense
&aelig;sthetic sense, through the beautiful in man.&nbsp; Man
with them was divine, inasmuch as he could perceive beauty and be
beautiful himself.&nbsp; Beauty might be physical,
&aelig;sthetic, intellectual, moral.&nbsp; But in proportion as a
thing was perfect it revealed its own perfection by its
beauty.&nbsp; Goodness itself was a form&mdash;though the highest
form&mdash;of beauty.&nbsp;
&Kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>meant both
the physically beautiful and the morally good;
&alpha;&#7984;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf; both the ugly and
the bad.</p>
<p>Out of this root-idea sprang the whole of that Greek
sculpture, which is still, and perhaps ever will be, one of the
unrivalled wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Their first statues, remember, were statues of the gods.&nbsp;
This is an historic fact.&nbsp; Before <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> 580 there were probably no statues in
Greece save those of deities.&nbsp; But of what form?&nbsp; We
all know that the usual tendency of man has been to represent his
gods as more or less monstrous.&nbsp; Their monstrosity may have
been meant, as it was certainly with the Mexican idols, and
probably those of the Semitic races of Syria and Palestine, to
symbolise the ferocious passions which they attributed to those
objects of their dread, appeasable alone by human
sacrifice.&nbsp; Or the monstrosity, as with the hawk-headed or
cat-headed Egyptian idols, the winged bulls of Nineveh and
Babylon, the many-handed deities of Hindostan&mdash;merely
symbolised powers which could not, so the priest and the sculptor
held, belong to mere humanity.&nbsp; Now, of such monstrous forms
of idols, the records in Greece are very few and very
ancient&mdash;relics of an older worship, and most probably of an
older race.&nbsp; From the earliest historic period, the Greek
was discerning more and more that the divine could be best
represented by the human; the tendency of his statuary was more
and more to honour that divine, by embodying it in the highest
human beauty.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>In lonely mountain shrines there still might linger,
feared and honoured, dolls like those black virgins, of unknown
antiquity, which still work wonders on the European
continent.&nbsp; In the mysterious cavern of Phigalia, for
instance, on the Eleatic shore of Peloponnese, there may have
been in remote times&mdash;so the legend ran&mdash;an old black
wooden image, a woman with a horse&rsquo;s head and mane, and
serpents growing round her head, who held a dolphin in one hand
and a dove in the other.&nbsp; And this image may have been
connected with old nature-myths about the marriage of Demeter and
Poseidon&mdash;that is, of encroachments of the sea upon the
land; and the other myths of Demeter, the earth-mother, may have
clustered round the place, till the Phigalians were
glad&mdash;for it was profitable as well as honourable&mdash;to
believe that in their cavern Demeter sat mourning for the loss of
Proserpine, whom Pluto had carried down to Hades, and all the
earth was barren till Zeus sent the Fates, or Iris, to call her
forth, and restore fertility to the world.&nbsp; And it may be
true&mdash;the legend as Pausanias tells it 600 years
after&mdash;that the old wooden idol having been burnt, and the
worship of Demeter neglected till a famine ensued, the
Phigalians, warned by the Oracle of Delphi, hired Onatas, a
contemporary of Polygnotus and Phidias, to make them a bronze
replica of the old idol, from some old copy and from a dream of
his own.&nbsp; The story may be <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>true.&nbsp;
When Pausanias went thither, in the second century after Christ,
the cave and the fountain, and the sacred grove of oaks, and the
altar outside, which was to be polluted with the blood of no
victim&mdash;the only offerings being fruits and honey, and
undressed wool&mdash;were still there.&nbsp; The statue was
gone.&nbsp; Some said it had been destroyed by the fall of the
cliff; some were not sure that it had ever been there at
all.&nbsp; And meanwhile Praxiteles had already brought to
perfection (Paus. 1, 2, sec. 4) the ideal of Demeter,
mother-like, as Her&eacute;&mdash;whom we still call Juno
now&mdash;but softer-featured, and her eyes more closed.</p>
<p>And so for mother earth, as for the rest, the best
representation of the divine was the human.&nbsp; Now, conceive
such an idea taking hold, however slowly, of a people of rare
physical beauty, of acutest eye for proportion and grace, with
opportunities of studying the human figure such as exist nowhere
now, save among tropic savages, and gifted, moreover, in that as
in all other matters, with that innate diligence, of which Mr.
Carlyle has said, &lsquo;that genius is only an infinite capacity
of taking pains,&rsquo; and we can understand somewhat of the
causes which produced those statues, human and divine, which awe
and shame the artificiality and degeneracy of our modern
so-called civilisation&mdash;we can understand somewhat of the
reverence for the human form, of the careful study of every line,
the storing up for use each scattered fragment <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of beauty of
which the artist caught sight, even in his daily walks, and
consecrating it in his memory to the service of him or her whom
he was trying to embody in marble or in bronze.&nbsp; And when
the fashion came in of making statues of victors in the games,
and other distinguished persons, a new element was introduced,
which had large social as well as artistic results.&nbsp; The
sculptor carried his usual reverence into his careful delineation
of the victor&rsquo;s form, while he obtained in him a model,
usually of the very highest type, for perfecting his idea of some
divinity.&nbsp; The possibility of gaining the right to a statue
gave a fresh impulse to all competitors in the public games, and
through them to the gymnastic training throughout all the states
of Greece, which made the Greeks the most physically able and
graceful, as well as the most beautiful people known to the
history of the human race.&nbsp; A people who, reverencing
beauty, reverenced likewise grace or acted beauty, so utterly and
honestly, that nothing was too humble for a free man to do, if it
were not done awkwardly and ill.&nbsp; As an instance, Sophocles
himself&mdash;over and above his poetic genius, one of the most
cultivated gentlemen, as well as one of the most exquisite
musicians, dancers, and gymnasts, and one of the most just,
pious, and gentle of all Greece&mdash;could not, by reason of the
weakness of his voice, act in his own plays, as poets were wont
to do, and had to perform only the <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>office of
stage-manager.&nbsp; Twice he took part in the action, once as
the blind old Thamyris playing on the harp, and once in his own
lost tragedy, the &lsquo;Nausicaa.&rsquo;&nbsp; There in the
scene in which the Princess, as she does in Homer&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Odyssey,&rsquo; comes down to the sea-shore with her
maidens to wash the household clothes, and then to play at
ball&mdash;Sophocles himself, a man then of middle age, did the
one thing he could do better than any there&mdash;and, dressed in
women&rsquo;s clothes, among the lads who represented the
maidens, played at ball before the Athenian people.</p>
<p>Yes: just 60 years after the representation of the
<i>Antigone</i>, 10,000 Greeks, far on the plains of Babylon, cut
through the whole Persian army, as the railway train cuts through
a herd of buffalo, and then losing all their generals by
treacherous warfare, fought their way north from Babylon to
Trebizond on the Black Sea, under the guidance of a young
Athenian, a pupil of Socrates, who had never served in the army
before.&nbsp; The retreat of Xenophon and his 10,000 will remain
for ever as one of the grandest triumphs of civilisation over
brute force: but what made it possible?&nbsp; That these men, and
their ancestors before them, had been for at least 100 years in
<i>training</i>, physical, intellectual, and moral, which made
their bodies and their minds able to dare and suffer like those
old heroes of whom their tragedy had taught them, and whose
spirits they still believed would help the <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>valiant
Greek.&nbsp; And yet that feat, which looks to us so splendid,
attracted, as far as I am aware, no special admiration at the
time.&nbsp; So was the cultivated Greek expected to behave
whenever he came in contact with the uncultivated barbarian.</p>
<p>But from what had sprung in that little state, this exuberance
of splendid life, physical, &aelig;sthetic, intellectual, which
made, and will make the name of Athens and of the whole cluster
of Greek republics for ever admirable to civilised man?&nbsp; Had
it sprung from long years of peaceful prosperity?&nbsp; From
infinite making of money and comfort, according to the laws of
so-called political economy, and the dictates of enlightened
selfishness?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; But rather out of terror and
agony, and all but utter ruin&mdash;and out of a magnificent want
of economy&mdash;and the divine daring and folly&mdash;of
self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In Salamis across the strait a trophy stood, and round that
trophy, forty years before, Sophocles the author of
<i>Antigone</i>, then sixteen years of age, the loveliest and
most cultivated lad in Athens, undraped like a faun, with lyre in
hand, was leading the Chorus of Athenian youths, and singing to
Athen&eacute;, the tutelary goddess, a hymn of triumph for a
glorious victory,&mdash;the very symbol of Greece and Athens,
springing up into a joyous second youth after invasion and
desolation, as the grass springs up after the prairie fire has
passed.&nbsp; But the fire had <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>been
terrible.&nbsp; It had burnt Athens at least, down to the very
roots.&nbsp; True, while Sophocles was dancing, Xerxes, the great
king of the East, foiled at Salamis, as his father Darius had
been foiled at Marathon ten years before, was fleeing back to
Persia, leaving his innumerable hosts of slaves and mercenaries
to be destroyed piecemeal, by land at Platea, by sea at
Mycal&eacute;.&nbsp; The bold hope was over, in which the
Persian, ever since the days of Cyrus, had indulged&mdash;that
he, the despot of the East, should be the despot of the West
likewise.&nbsp; It seemed to them as possible, though not as
easy, to subdue the Aryan Greek, as it had been to subdue the
Semite and the Turanian, the Babylonian, and the Syrian; to rifle
his temples, to destroy his idols, carry off his women and
children as colonists into distant lands, as they had been doing
with all the nations of the East.&nbsp; And they had succeeded
with isolated colonies, isolated islands of Greeks, and the
shores of Asia Minor.&nbsp; But when they dared, at last, to
attack the Greek in his own sacred land of Hellas, they found
they had bearded a lion in his den.&nbsp; Nay rather&mdash;as
those old Greeks would have said&mdash;they had dared to attack
Pallas Athen&eacute;, the eldest daughter of Zeus&mdash;emblem of
that serene and pure divine wisdom, of whom Solomon sang of old:
&lsquo;The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before
His works of old.&nbsp; When He prepared the heavens, I was
there, when He appointed the foundation <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>of the earth,
then was I by Him, as one brought up with Him, and I was daily
His delight, rejoicing always before him: rejoicing in the
habitable part of His earth; <i>and my delight was with the sons
of men</i>,&rsquo;&mdash;to attack her and her brother Apollo,
Lord of light, and beauty, and culture, and grace, and
inspiration,&mdash;to attack them, not in the name of Ormuzd, nor
of any other deity, but in the name of mere brute force and lust
of conquest.&nbsp; The old Persian spirit was gone out of
them.&nbsp; They were the symbols now of nothing save despotism
and self-will, wealth and self-indulgence.&nbsp; They, once the
children of Ormuzd or light, had become the children of Ahriman
or darkness; and therefore it was, as I believe, that
Xerxes&rsquo; 1,000 ships, and the two million (or, as some have
it, five million) human beings availed naught against the little
fleets and little battalions of men who believed with a living
belief in Athen&eacute; and Apollo, and therefore&mdash;ponder it
well, for it is true&mdash;with a living belief, under whatsoever
confusions and divisions of personality, in a God who loved,
taught, inspired men, a just God who befriended the righteous
cause, the cause of freedom and patriotism, a Deity, the echo of
whose mind and will to man was the song of Athen&eacute; on
Olympus, when she</p>
<blockquote><p>Chanted of order and right, and of foresight, and
order of peoples;<br />
Chanted of labour and craft, wealth in the port and the
garner;<br />
<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>Chanted of valour and fame, and the man who can fall
with the foremost,<br />
Fighting for children and wife, and the field which his father
bequeathed him.<br />
Sweetly and cunningly sang she, and planned new lessons for
mortals.<br />
Happy who hearing obey her, the wise unsullied Athen&eacute;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, that they had always obeyed her, those old Greeks.&nbsp;
But meanwhile, as I said, the agony had been extreme.&nbsp; If
Athens had sinned, she had been purged as by fire; and the
fire&mdash;surely of God&mdash;had been terrible.&nbsp; Northern
Greece had either been laid waste with fire and sword, or had
gone over to the Persian, traitors in their despair.&nbsp;
Attica, almost the only loyal state, had been overrun; the old
men, women, and children had fled to the neighbouring islands, or
to the Peloponnese.&nbsp; Athens itself had been destroyed; and
while young Sophocles was dancing round the trophy at Salamis,
the Acropolis was still a heap of blackened ruins.</p>
<p>But over and above their valour, over and above their loyalty,
over and above their exquisite &aelig;sthetic faculty, these
Athenians had a resilience of self-reliant energy, like that of
the French&mdash;like that, to do you but justice, of your
Americans after your Chicago fire; and Athens rose from her ashes
to be awhile, not only, as she had nobly earned by suffering and
endurance, the leading state in Greece, but a mighty <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>fortress, a rich commercial port, a living centre of
art, poetry, philosophy, such as this earth has never seen before
or since.</p>
<p>On the plateau of that little crag of the Acropolis some 800
feet in length, by 400 in breadth&mdash;about the size and shape
of the Castle Rock at Edinburgh&mdash;was gathered, within forty
years of the battle of Salamis, more and more noble beauty than
ever stood together on any other spot of like size.</p>
<p>The sudden relief from crushing pressure, and the joyous
consciousness of well-earned honours, made the whole
spirit-nature of the people blossom out, as it were, into
manifold forms of activity, beauty, research, and raised, in
raising Greece, the whole human race thenceforth.</p>
<p>What might they not have done&mdash;looking at what they
actually did&mdash;for the whole race of man?</p>
<p>But no&mdash;they fell, even more rapidly than they rose, till
their grace and their cultivation, for them they could not lose,
made them the willing ministers to the luxury, the frivolity, the
sentimentality, the vice of the whole old world&mdash;the Scapia
or Figaro of the old world&mdash;infinitely able, but with all
his ability consecrated to the service of his own base
self.&nbsp; The Greekling&mdash;as Juvenal has it&mdash;in want
of a dinner, would climb somehow to heaven itself, at the bidding
of his Roman master.</p>
<p>Ah, what a fall!&nbsp; And what was the inherent weakness
which caused that fall?</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>I say at once&mdash;want of honesty.&nbsp; The Greek was
not to be depended on; if it suited him, he would lie, betray,
overreach, change sides, and think it no sin.&nbsp; He was the
sharpest of men.&nbsp; Sharp practice, in our modern sense of the
word, was the very element in which he floated.&nbsp; Any scholar
knows it.&nbsp; In the grand times of Marathon and Salamis, down
to the disastrous times of the Peloponnesian war and the thirty
tyrants, no public man&rsquo;s hands were clean, with the
exception, perhaps, of that Aristides, who was banished because
men were tired of hearing him called the Just.&nbsp; The exciting
cause of the Peloponnesian war, and the consequent downfall of
Athens, was not merely the tyranny she exercised over the states
allied to her, it was the sharp practice of the Athenians, in
misappropriating the tribute paid by the allies to the decoration
of Athens.&nbsp; And in laying the foundations of the Parthenon
was sown, by a just judgment, the seed of ruin for the state
which gloried in it.&nbsp; And if the rulers were such, what were
the people?&nbsp; If the free were such, what were the
slaves?</p>
<p>Hence, weakness at home and abroad, mistrust of generals and
admirals, paralysing all bold and clear action, peculations and
corruptions at home, internecine wars between factions inside
states, and between states or groups of states, revolutions
followed by despotism, and final exhaustion and slavery,&mdash;
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>slavery to a people who were coming across the western
sea, hard-headed, hard-hearted, caring nothing for art, or
science, whose pleasures were coarse and cruel, but with a
certain rough honesty, reverence for country, for law, and for
the ties of a family&mdash;men of a somewhat old English type,
who had over and above, like the English, the inspiring belief
that they could conquer the whole world, and who very nearly
succeeded in that&mdash;as we have, to our great blessing, not
succeeded&mdash;I mean, of course, the Romans.</p>

65</span>LECTURE III.<br />
THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</h2>
<p>Let me begin this lecture with a scene in the North Atlantic
863 years since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bjarne Grimolfson was blown with his ship into the
Irish Ocean; and there came worms and the ship began to sink
under them.&nbsp; They had a boat which they had payed with
seals&rsquo; blubber, for that the sea-worms will not hurt.&nbsp;
But when they got into the boat they saw that it would not hold
them all.&nbsp; Then said Bjarne, &ldquo;As the boat will only
hold the half of us, my advice is that we should draw lots who
shall go in her; for that will not be unworthy of our
manhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; This advice seemed so good that none
gainsaid it; and they drew lots.&nbsp; And the lot fell to Bjarne
that he should go in the boat with half his crew.&nbsp; But as he
got into the boat, there spake an Icelander who was in the ship
and had followed Bjarne from Iceland, &ldquo;Art thou going to
leave me here, Bjarne?&rdquo;&nbsp; Quoth Bjarne, &ldquo;So it
must be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said the man, &ldquo;Another thing
didst thou promise my father, when I <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>sailed with
thee from Iceland, than to desert me thus.&nbsp; For thou saidst
that we both should share the same lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bjarne said,
&ldquo;And that we will not do.&nbsp; Get thou down into the
boat, and I will get up into the ship, now I see that thou art so
greedy after life.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Bjarne went up into the ship,
and the man down into the boat; and the boat went on its voyage
till they came to Dublin in Ireland.&nbsp; But most men say that
Bjarne and his comrades perished among the worms; for they were
never heard of after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This story may serve as a text for my whole lecture.&nbsp; Not
only does it smack of the sea-breeze and the salt water like all
the finest old Norse sagas: but it gives a glimpse at least, of
the nobleness which underlay the grim and often cruel nature of
the Norseman.&nbsp; It belongs, too, to the culminating epoch, to
the beginning of that era when the Scandinavian peoples had their
great times; when the old fierceness of the worshippers of Thor
and Odin was tempered, without being effeminated by the Faith of
the &lsquo;White Christ,&rsquo; till the very men who had been
the destroyers of Western Europe became its civilisers.</p>
<p>It should have, moreover, a special interest to
Americans.&nbsp; For&mdash;as American antiquaries are well
aware&mdash;Bjarne was on his voyage home from the coast of New
England; possibly from that very Mount Hope Bay, which seems to
have borne the same name in the time of those old Norsemen, as
afterwards in the days <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>of King Philip the last sachem of the
Wampanong Indians.&nbsp; He was going back to Greenland, perhaps
for reinforcements, finding, he and his fellow-captain, Thorfinn,
the Esquimaux who then dwelt in that land too strong for
them.&nbsp; For the Norsemen were then on the very edge of a
discovery, which might have changed the history not only of this
continent but of Europe likewise.&nbsp; They had found and
colonised Iceland and Greenland.&nbsp; They had found Labrador,
and called it Helluland, from its ice-polished rocks.&nbsp; They
had found Nova Scotia seemingly and called it Markland from its
woods.&nbsp; They had found New England and called it Vinland the
Good.&nbsp; A fair land they found it, well wooded, with good
pasturage; so that they had already imported cows, and a bull
whose lowings terrified the Esquimaux.&nbsp; They had found
self-sown corn too, probably maize.&nbsp; The streams were full
of salmon.&nbsp; But they had called the land Vinland, by reason
of its grapes.&nbsp; Quaint enough, and bearing in its very
quaintness the stamp of truth, is the story of the first finding
of the wild fox-grapes.&nbsp; How Leif the Fortunate, almost as
soon as he first landed, missed a little wizened old German
servant of his father&rsquo;s, Tyrker by name, and was much vexed
thereat, for he had been brought up on the old man&rsquo;s knee,
and hurrying off to find him met Tyrker coming back twisting his
eyes about&mdash;a trick of his&mdash;smacking his lips and
talking German to himself in high <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>excitement.&nbsp; And when they get him to talk Norse
again, he says, &lsquo;I have not been far, but I have news for
you.&nbsp; I have found vines and grapes!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
that true, foster-father?&rsquo; says Leif.&nbsp; &lsquo;True it
is,&rsquo; says the old German, &lsquo;for I was brought up where
there was never any lack of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The saga&mdash;as
given by Rafn&mdash;has a detailed description of this quaint
personage&rsquo;s appearance; and it would not be amiss if
American wine-growers should employ an American
sculptor&mdash;and there are great American sculptors&mdash;to
render that description into marble, and set up little Tyrker in
some public place, as the Silenus of the New World.</p>
<p>Thus the first cargoes homeward from Vinland to Greenland had
been of timber and of raisins, and of vine-stocks which were not
like to thrive.</p>
<p>And more.&nbsp; Beyond Vinland the Good there was said to be
another land, Whiteman&rsquo;s Land&mdash;or Ireland the Mickle,
as some called it.&nbsp; For these Norse traders from Limerick
had found Ari Marson, and Ketla of Ruykjanes, supposed to have
been long since drowned at sea, and said that the people had made
him and Ketla chiefs, and baptised Ari.&nbsp; What is all this?
and what is this, too, which the Esquimaux children taken in
Markland told the Northmen, of a land beyond them where the folk
wore white clothes, and carried flags on poles?&nbsp; Are these
all dreams? or was some part of that great civilisation, the
relics <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>whereof your antiquarians find in so
many parts of the United States, still in existence some 900
years ago; and were these old Norse cousins of ours upon the very
edge of it?&nbsp; Be that as it may, how nearly did these fierce
Vikings, some of whom seemed to have sailed far south along the
shore, become aware that just beyond them lay a land of fruits
and spices, gold, and gems?&nbsp; The adverse current of the Gulf
Stream, it may be, would have long prevented their getting past
the Bahamas into the Gulf of Mexico; but, sooner or later, some
storm must have carried a Greenland viking to San Domingo, or to
Cuba; and then, as has been well said, some Scandinavian dynasty
might have sat upon the throne of Mexico.</p>
<p>These stories are well known to antiquarians.&nbsp; They may
be found, almost all of them, in Professor Rafn&rsquo;s
<i>Antiquitates American&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; The action in them
stands out often so clear and dramatic, that the internal
evidence of historic truth is irresistible.&nbsp; Thorvald, who,
when he saw what seems to be, they say, the bluff head of
Alderton at the south-east end of Boston Bay, said, &lsquo;Here
should I like to dwell,&rsquo; and, shot by an Esquimaux arrow,
bade bury him on that place, with a cross at his head and a cross
at his feet, and call the place Cross Ness for evermore; Gudrida,
the magnificent widow, who wins hearts and sees strange deeds
from Iceland to Greenland, and Greenland to Vinland and back, and
at last, worn out and sad, goes <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>off on a
pilgrimage to Rome; Helgi and Finnbogi, the Norwegians, who, like
our Arctic voyagers in after times, devise all sorts of sports
and games to keep the men in humour during the long winter at
Hope; and last, but not least, the terrible Freydisa, who when
the Norse are seized with a sudden panic at the Esquimaux, and
flee from them, as they had three weeks before fled from
Thorfinn&rsquo;s bellowing bull, turns, when so weak that she
cannot escape, single-handed on the savages, and catching up a
slain man&rsquo;s sword, puts them all to flight with her fierce
visage and fierce cries&mdash;Freydisa the Terrible, who, in
another voyage, persuades her husband to fall on Helgi and
Finnbogi, when asleep, and murder them and all their men; and
then, when he will not murder the five women too, takes up an axe
and slays them all herself, and getting back to Greenland, when
the dark and unexplained tale comes out, lives unpunished, but
abhorred henceforth.&nbsp; All these folks, I say, are no
phantoms, but realities; at least, if I can judge of internal
evidence.</p>
<p>But, beyond them, and hovering on the verge of Mythus and
fairy land, there is a ballad called &lsquo;Finn the Fair,&rsquo;
and how</p>
<blockquote><p>An upland Earl had twa braw sons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My story to begin;<br />
The tane was hight Haldane the strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tither was winsome Finn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>and so forth; which was still sung, with other
&lsquo;rimur,&rsquo; or ballads, in the Faroes, at the end of the
last century.&nbsp; Professor Rafn has inserted it, because it
talks of Vinland as a well-known place, and because the brothers
are sent by the princess to slay American kings; but that Rime
has another value.</p>
<p>It is of a beauty so perfect, and yet so like the old Scotch
ballads in its heroic conception of love, and in all its forms
and its qualities, that it is one proof more, to any student of
early European poetry, that we and these old Norsemen are men of
the same blood.&nbsp; Your own Professor Longfellow may know it
far better than I, who am no Norse scholar.&nbsp; But, if he
does, might I beg him to translate it some day, as none but he
can translate?&nbsp; It is so sad, that no tenderness less
exquisite than his can prevent its being painful; and, at least
in its denouement, so naive, that no purity less exquisite than
his can prevent its being dreadful.&nbsp; But the Rime is as
worthy of Mr. Longfellow as he is worthy of the Rime.</p>
<p>If anything more important than is told by Professor Rafn and
Mr. Black <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a> be now known to the antiquarians of
Massachussets, let me entreat them to pardon my ignorance.&nbsp;
But let me record my opinion that, though somewhat too much may
have been made in past years of certain rock-inscriptions, and
<!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>so forth, on this side of the Atlantic, there can be no
reasonable doubt that our own race landed and tried to settle on
the shore of New England six hundred years before their kinsmen,
and, in many cases, their actual descendants, the august Pilgrim
Fathers of the 17th century.&nbsp; And so, as I said, a
Scandinavian dynasty might have been seated now upon the throne
of Mexico.&nbsp; And how was that strange chance lost?&nbsp;
First, of course, by the length and danger of the coasting
voyage.&nbsp; It was one thing to have, like Columbus and
Vespucci, Cortes and Pizarro, the Azores as a half-way port;
another to have Greenland, or even Iceland.&nbsp; It was one
thing to run South West upon Columbus&rsquo; track, across the
Mar de Damas, the Ladies Sea, which hardly knows a storm, with
the blazing blue above, the blazing blue below, in an
ever-warming climate, where every breath is life and joy; another
to struggle against the fogs and icebergs, the rocks and
currents, of the dreary North Atlantic.&nbsp; No wonder, then,
that the knowledge of Markland, and Vinland, and Whiteman&rsquo;s
Land died away in a few generations, and became but fire-side
sagas for the winter nights.</p>
<p>But there were other causes, more honourable to the dogged
energy of the Norse.&nbsp; They were in those very years
conquering and settling nearer home as no other
people&mdash;unless, perhaps, the old Ionian Greeks, conquered
and settled.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Greenland, we have seen, they held&mdash;the western
side at least&mdash;and held it long and well enough to afford,
it is said, 2,600 pounds of walrus&rsquo; teeth as yearly tithe
to the Pope, besides Peter&rsquo;s pence, and to build many a
convent, and church, and cathedral, with farms and homesteads
round; for one saga speaks of Greenland as producing wheat of the
finest quality.&nbsp; All is ruined now, perhaps by gradual
change of climate.</p>
<p>But they had richer fields of enterprise than Greenland,
Iceland, and the Faroes.&nbsp; Their boldest outlaws at that very
time&mdash;whether from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, or
Britain&mdash;were forming the imperial life-guard of the
Byzantine Emperor, as the once famous Varangers of
Constantinople; and that splendid epoch of their race was just
dawning, of which my lamented friend, the late Sir Edmund Head,
says so well in his preface to Viga Glum&rsquo;s Icelandic
<i>Saga</i>, &lsquo;The Sagas, of which this tale is one, were
composed for the men who have left their mark in every corner of
Europe; and whose language and laws are at this moment important
elements in the speech and institutions of England, America, and
Australia.&nbsp; There is no page of modern history in which the
influence of the Norsemen and their conquests must not be taken
into account&mdash;Russia, Constantinople, Greece, Palestine,
Sicily, the coasts of Africa, Southern Italy, France, the Spanish
Peninsula, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>England, Scotland, Ireland, and every
rock and island round them, have been visited, and most of them
at one time or the other ruled, by the men of Scandinavia.&nbsp;
The motto on the sword of Roger Guiscard was a proud one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Appulus et Calaber, Siculus mihi servit et
Afer.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every island, says Sir Edmund Head, and truly&mdash;for the
name of almost every island on the coast of England, Scotland,
and Eastern Ireland, ends in either <i>ey</i> or <i>ay</i> or
<i>oe</i>, a Norse appellative, as is the word island
itself&mdash;is a mark of its having been, at some time or other,
visited by the Vikings of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Norway, meanwhile, was convulsed by war; and what perhaps was
of more immediate consequence, Svend Fork-beard, whom we
Englishmen call Sweyn&mdash;the renegade from that Christian
Faith which had been forced on him by his German conqueror, the
Emperor Otto II.&mdash;with his illustrious son Cnut, whom we
call Canute, were just calling together all the most daring
spirits of the Baltic coasts for the subjugation of England; and
when that great feat was performed, the Scandinavian emigration
was paralysed, probably, for a time by the fearful wars at
home.&nbsp; While the King of Sweden, and St. Olaf Tryggvason,
king of Norway, were setting on Denmark during Cnut&rsquo;s
pilgrimage to Rome, and Cnut, <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>sailing with
a mighty fleet to Norway, was driving St. Olaf into Russia, to
return and fall in the fratricidal battle of
Stiklestead&mdash;during, strangely enough, a total eclipse of
the sun&mdash;Vinland was like enough to remain still
uncolonised.&nbsp; After Cnut&rsquo;s short-lived
triumph&mdash;king as he was of Denmark, Norway, England, and
half Scotland, and what not of Wendish Folk inside the
Baltic&mdash;the force of the Norsemen seems to have been
exhausted in their native lands.&nbsp; Once more only, if I
remember right, did &lsquo;Lochlin,&rsquo; really and hopefully
send forth her &lsquo;mailed swarm&rsquo; to conquer a foreign
land; and with a result unexpected alike by them and by their
enemies.&nbsp; Had it been otherwise, we might not have been here
this day.</p>
<p>Let me sketch for you once more&mdash;though you have heard
it, doubtless, many a time&mdash;the tale of that tremendous
fortnight which settled the fate of Britain, and therefore of
North America; which decided&mdash;just in those great times when
the decision was to be made&mdash;whether we should be on a par
with the other civilised nations of Europe, like them the
&lsquo;heirs of all the ages,&rsquo; with our share not only of
Roman Christianity and Roman centralisation&mdash;a member of the
great comity of European nations, held together in one Christian
bond by the Pope&mdash;but heirs also of Roman civilisation,
Roman literature, Roman law; and therefore, in due time, of Greek
philosophy and art.&nbsp; No less a question than this, it seems
to me, <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>hung in the balance during that
fortnight of autumn, 1066.</p>
<p>Poor old Edward the Confessor, holy, weak, and sad, lay in his
new choir of Westminster&mdash;where the wicked ceased from
troubling, and the weary were at rest.&nbsp; The crowned ascetic
had left no heir behind.&nbsp; England seemed as a corpse, to
which all the eagles might gather together; and the
South-English, in their utter need, had chosen for their king the
ablest, and it may be the justest, man in Britain&mdash;Earl
Harold Godwinsson: himself, like half the upper classes of
England then, of the all-dominant Norse blood; for his mother was
a Danish princess.&nbsp; Then out of Norway, with a mighty host,
came Harold Hardraade, taller than all men, the ideal Viking of
his time.&nbsp; Half-brother of the now dead St. Olaf, severely
wounded when he was but fifteen, at Stiklestead, when Olaf fell,
he had warred and plundered on many a coast.&nbsp; He had been
away to Russia to King Jaroslaf; he had been in the
Emperor&rsquo;s Varanger guard at Constantinople&mdash;and, it
was whispered, had slain a lion there with his bare hands; he had
carved his name and his comrades&rsquo; in Runic
characters&mdash;if you go to Venice you may see them at this
day&mdash;on the loins of the great marble lion, which stood in
his time not in Venice but in Athens.&nbsp; And now, king of
Norway and conqueror, for the time, of Denmark, why should he not
take England, as <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Sweyn and Canute took it sixty years
before, when the flower of the English gentry perished at the
fatal battle of Assingdune?&nbsp; If he and his half-barbarous
host had conquered, the civilisation of Britain would have been
thrown back, perhaps, for centuries.&nbsp; But it was not to
be.</p>
<p>England <i>was</i> to be conquered by the Norman; but by the
civilised, not the barbaric; by the Norse who had settled, but
four generations before, in the North East of France under Rou,
Rollo, Rolf the Ganger&mdash;so-called, they say, because his
legs were so long that, when on horseback, he touched the ground
and seemed to gang, or walk.&nbsp; He and his Norsemen had taken
their share of France, and called it Normandy to this day; and
meanwhile, with that docility and adaptability which marks so
often truly great spirits, they had changed their creed, their
language, their habits, and had become, from heathen and
murderous Berserkers, the most truly civilised people of Europe,
and&mdash;as was most natural then&mdash;the most faithful allies
and servants of the Pope of Rome.&nbsp; So greatly had they
changed, and so fast, that William Duke of Normandy, the
great-great-grandson of Rolf the wild Viking, was perhaps the
finest gentleman, as well as the most cultivated sovereign, and
the greatest statesman and warrior, in all Europe.</p>
<p>So Harold of Norway came with all his Vikings to Stamford
Bridge by York; and took, by coming, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>only that
which Harold of England promised him, namely, &lsquo;forasmuch as
he was taller than any other man, seven feet of English
ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story of that great battle, told with a few inaccuracies,
but told as only great poets tell, you should read, if you have
not read it already, in the <i>Heimskringla</i> of Snorri
Sturluson, the Homer of the North&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>High feast that day held the birds of the air and
the beasts of the field,<br />
White-tailed erne and sallow glede,<br />
Dusky raven, with horny neb,<br />
And the grey deer, the wolf of the wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bones of the slain, men say, whitened the place for fifty
years to come.</p>
<p>And remember, that on the same day on which that fight
befell&mdash;Sept. 27, 1066&mdash;William, Duke of Normandy, with
all his French-speaking Norsemen, was sailing across the British
Channel, under the protection of a banner consecrated by the
Pope, to conquer that England which the Norse-speaking Normans
could not conquer.</p>
<p>And now King Harold showed himself a man.&nbsp; He turned at
once from the North of England to the South.&nbsp; He raised the
folk of the Southern, as he had raised those of the Central and
Northern shires; and in sixteen days&mdash;after a march which in
those <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>times was a prodigious feat&mdash;he
was entrenched upon the fatal down which men called Heathfield
then, and Senlac, but Battle to this day&mdash;with William and
his French Normans opposite him on Telham hill.</p>
<p>Then came the battle of Hastings.&nbsp; You all know what
befell upon that day; and how the old weapon was matched against
the new&mdash;the English axe against the Norman lance&mdash;and
beaten only because the English broke their ranks.&nbsp; If you
wish to refresh your memories, read the tale once more in Mr.
Freeman&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>, or Prof.
Creasy&rsquo;s <i>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</i>, or
even, best of all, the late Lord Lytton&rsquo;s splendid romance
of <i>Harold</i>.&nbsp; And when you go to England, go, as some
of you may have gone already, to Battle; and there from off the
Abbey grounds, or from Mountjoy behind, look down off what was
then &lsquo;The Heathy Field,&rsquo; over the long slopes of
green pasture and the rich hop-gardens, where were no hop-gardens
then, and the flat tide-marshes winding between the wooded
heights, towards the southern sea; and imagine for yourselves the
feelings of an Englishman as he contemplates that broad green
sloping lawn, on which was decided the destiny of his native
land.&nbsp; Here, right beneath, rode Taillefer up the slope
before them all, singing the song of Roland, tossing his lance in
air and catching it as it fell, with all the <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Norse
berserker spirit of his ancestors flashing out in him, at the
thought of one fair fight, and then purgatory, or
Valhalla&mdash;Taillefer perhaps preferred the latter.&nbsp;
Yonder on the left, in that copse where the red-ochre gully runs,
is Sanguelac, the drain of blood, into which (as the Bayeux
tapestry, woven by Matilda&rsquo;s maids, still shows) the Norman
knights fell, horse and man, till the gully was bridged with
writhing bodies for those who rode after.&nbsp; Here, where you
stand&mdash;the crest of the hill marks where it must have
been&mdash;was the stockade on which depended the fate of
England.&nbsp; Yonder, perhaps, stalked out one English squire or
house-carle after another: tall men with long-handled
battle-axes&mdash;one specially terrible, with a wooden helmet
which no sword could pierce&mdash;who hewed and hewed down knight
on knight, till they themselves were borne to earth at
last.&nbsp; And here, among the trees and ruins of the garden,
kept trim by those who know the treasure which they own, stood
Harold&rsquo;s two standards of the fighting man and the dragon
of Wessex.&nbsp; And here, close by (for here, for many a
century, stood the high altar of Battle Abbey, where monks sang
masses for Harold&rsquo;s soul), upon this very spot the
Swan-neck found her hero lover&rsquo;s corpse.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says many an Englishman&mdash;and who will
blame him for it&mdash;&lsquo;how grand to have died beneath that
standard on that day!&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, and how right.&nbsp; And
yet how right, likewise, that the <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Norman&rsquo;s cry of Dexaie, &lsquo;God Help,&rsquo;
and not the English hurrah, should have won that day, till
William rode up Mountjoye in the afternoon to see the English
army, terrible even in defeat, struggling through copse and marsh
away toward Brede, and, like retreating lions driven into their
native woods, slaying more in the pursuit than they slew even in
the fight.</p>
<p>But so it was to be; for so it ought to have been.&nbsp; You,
my American friends, delight, as I have said already, in seeing
the old places of the old country.&nbsp; Go, I beg you, and look
at that old place, and if you be wise, you will carry back from
it one lesson: that God&rsquo;s thoughts are not as our thoughts;
nor His ways as our ways.</p>
<p>It was a fearful time which followed.&nbsp; I cannot but
believe that our forefathers had been, in some way or other,
great sinners, or two such conquests as Canute&rsquo;s and
William&rsquo;s would not have fallen on them within the short
space of sixty years.&nbsp; They did not want for courage, as
Stanford Brigg and Hastings showed full well.&nbsp; English
swine, their Norman conquerors called them often enough; but
never English cowards.&nbsp; Their ruinous vice, if we are to
trust the records of the time, was what the old monks called
accidia&mdash;&#7936;&chi;&eta;&delta;&#943;&alpha;&mdash;and
ranked it as one of the seven deadly sins: a general careless,
sleepy, comfortable habit of mind, which lets all go <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>its
way for good or evil&mdash;a habit of mind too often accompanied,
as in the case of the Anglo-Danes, with self-indulgence, often
coarse enough.&nbsp; Huge eaters and huger drinkers, fuddled with
ale, were the men who went down at Hastings&mdash;though they
went down like heroes&mdash;before the staid and sober Norman out
of France.</p>
<p>But those were fearful times.&nbsp; As long as William lived,
ruthless as he was to all rebels, he kept order and did justice
with a strong and steady hand; for he brought with him from
Normandy the instincts of a truly great statesman.&nbsp; And in
his sons&rsquo; time matters grew worse and worse.&nbsp; After
that, in the troubles of Stephen&rsquo;s reign, anarchy let loose
tyranny in its most fearful form, and things were done which
recall the cruelties of the old Spanish conquistadores in
America.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s charming romance of <i>Ivanhoe</i>
must be taken, I fear, as a too true picture of English society
in the time of Richard I.</p>
<p>And what came of it all?&nbsp; What was the result of all this
misery and wrong?</p>
<p>This, paradoxical as it may seem&mdash;that the Norman
conquest was the making of the English people; of the Free
Commons of England.</p>
<p>Paradoxical, but true.&nbsp; First, you must dismiss from your
minds the too common notion that there is now, in England a
governing Norman aristocracy, or that there has been one, at
least since the year <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>1215, when Magna Charta was won from
the Norman John by Normans and by English alike.&nbsp; For the
first victors at Hastings, like the first conquistadores in
America, perished, as the monk chronicles point out, rapidly by
their own crimes; and very few of our nobility can trace their
names back to the authentic Battle Abbey roll.&nbsp; The great
majority of the peers have sprung from, and all have intermarried
with, the Commons; and the peerage has been from the first, and
has become more and more as centuries have rolled on, the prize
of success in life.</p>
<p>The cause is plain.&nbsp; The conquest of England by the
Normans was not one of those conquests of a savage by a civilised
race, or of a cowardly race by a brave race, which results in the
slavery of the conquered, and leaves the gulf of caste between
two races, master and slave.&nbsp; That was the case in France,
and resulted, after centuries of oppression, in the great and
dreadful revolution of 1793, which convulsed not only France but
the whole civilised world.&nbsp; But caste, thank God, has never
existed in England, since at least the first generation after the
Norman conquest.</p>
<p>The vast majority, all but the whole population of England,
have been always free; and free, as they are not where caste
exists, to change their occupations.&nbsp; They could intermarry,
if they were able men, into the ranks above them; as they did
sink, if they <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>were unable men, into the ranks below
them.&nbsp; Any man acquainted with the origin of our English
surnames may verify this fact for himself, by looking at the
names of a single parish or a single street of shops.&nbsp;
There, jumbled together, he will find names marking the noblest
Saxon or Angle blood&mdash;Kenward or Kenric, Osgood or Osborne,
side by side with Cordery or Banister&mdash;now names of farmers
in my own parish&mdash;or other Norman-French names which may be,
like those two last, in Battle Abbey roll&mdash;and side by side
the almost ubiquitous Brown, whose ancestor was probably some
Danish or Norwegian housecarle, proud of his name Biorn the bear,
and the ubiquitous Smith or Smythe, the smiter, whose forefather,
whether he now be peasant or peer, assuredly handled the tongs
and hammer at his own forge.&nbsp; This holds true equally in New
England and in Old.&nbsp; When I search through (as I delight to
do) your New England surnames, I find the same jumble of
names&mdash;West Saxon, Angle, Danish, Norman, and French-Norman
likewise, many of prim&aelig;val and heathen antiquity, many of
high nobility, all worked together, as at home, to form the Free
Commoners of England.</p>
<p>If any should wish to know more on this curious and important
subject, let me recommend them to study Ferguson&rsquo;s
<i>Teutonic Name System</i>, a book from which you will discover
that some of our quaintest, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and seemingly
most plebeian surnames&mdash;many surnames, too, which are
extinct in England, but remain in America&mdash;are really
corruptions of good old Teutonic names, which our ancestors may
have carried in the German Forest, before an Englishman set foot
on British soil; from which he will rise with the comfortable
feeling that we English-speaking men, from the highest to the
lowest, are literally kinsmen.&nbsp; Nay, so utterly made up now
is the old blood-feud between Norseman and Englishman, between
the descendants of those who conquered and those who were
conquered, that in the children of our Prince of Wales, after 800
years, the blood of William of Normandy is mingled with the blood
of the very Harold who fell at Hastings.&nbsp; And so, by the
bitter woes which followed the Norman conquest was the whole
population, Dane, Angle, and Saxon, earl and churl, freeman and
slave, crushed and welded together into one homogeneous mass,
made just and merciful towards each other by the most wholesome
of all teachings, a community of suffering; and if they had been,
as I fear they were, a lazy and a sensual people, were taught</p>
<blockquote><p>That life is not as idle ore,<br />
But heated hot with burning fears,<br />
And bathed in baths of hissing tears,<br />
And battered with the strokes of doom<br />
To shape and use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>But how did these wild Vikings become Christian
men?&nbsp; It is a long story.&nbsp; So staunch a race was sure
to be converted only very slowly.&nbsp; Noble missionaries as
Ansgar, Rembert, and Poppo, had worked for 150 years and more
among the heathens of Denmark.&nbsp; But the patriotism of the
Norseman always recoiled, even though in secret, from the fact
that they were German monks, backed by the authority of the
German emperor; and many a man, like Svend Fork-beard, father of
the great Canute, though he had the Kaiser himself for godfather,
turned heathen once more, the moment he was free, because his
baptism was the badge of foreign conquest, and neither pope nor
Kaiser should lord it over him, body or soul.&nbsp; St. Olaf,
indeed, forced Christianity on the Norse at the sword&rsquo;s
point, often by horrid cruelties, and perished in the
attempt.&nbsp; But who forced it on the Norsemen of Scotland,
England, Ireland, Neustria, Russia, and all the Eastern
Baltic?&nbsp; It was absorbed and in most cases, I believe,
gradually and willingly, as a gospel and good news to hearts worn
out with the storm of their own passions.&nbsp; And whence came
their Christianity?&nbsp; Much of it, as in the case of the
Danes, and still more of the French Normans, came direct from
Rome, the city which, let them defy its influence as they would,
was still the fount of all theology, as well as of all
civilisation.&nbsp; But I must believe that much of it came <!--
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>from that mysterious ancient Western Church, the Church
of St. Patric, St. Bridget, St. Columba, which had covered with
rude cells and chapels the rocky islets of the North Atlantic,
even to Iceland itself.&nbsp; Even to Iceland; for when that
island was first discovered, about <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 840, the Norsemen found in an isle, on
the east and west and elsewhere, Irish books and bells and wooden
crosses, and named that island Papey, the isle of the
popes&mdash;some little colony of monks, who lived by fishing,
and who are said to have left the land when the Norsemen settled
in it.&nbsp; Let us believe, for it is consonant with reason and
experience, that the sight of those poor monks, plundered and
massacred again and again by the &lsquo;mailed swarms of
Lochlin,&rsquo; yet never exterminated, but springing up again in
the same place, ready for fresh massacre, a sacred plant which
God had planted, and which no rage of man could trample
out&mdash;let us believe, I say, that that sight taught at last
to the buccaneers of the old world that there was a purer
manliness, a loftier heroism, than the ferocious self-assertion
of the Berserker, even the heroism of humility, gentleness,
self-restraint, self-sacrifice.&nbsp; That there was a strength
which was made perfect in weakness; a glory, not of the sword but
of the cross.&nbsp; We will believe that that was the lesson
which the Norsemen learnt, after many a wild and bloodstained
voyage, from the monks of Iona or of <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Derry, which
caused the building of such churches as that which Sightrys, king
of Dublin, raised about the year 1030, not in the Norse but in
the Irish quarter of Dublin: a sacred token of amity between the
new settlers and the natives on the ground of a common
faith.&nbsp; Let us believe, too, that the influence of woman was
not wanting in the good work&mdash;that the story of St. Margaret
and Malcolm Canmore was repeated, though inversely, in the case
of many a heathen Scandinavian jarl, who, marrying the princely
daughter of some Scottish chieftain, found in her creed at last
something more precious than herself; while his brother or his
cousin became, at Dublin or Wexford or Waterford, the husband of
some saffron-robed Irish princess, &lsquo;fair as an elf,&rsquo;
as the old saying was; &lsquo;some maiden of the three
transcendent hues,&rsquo; of whom the old book of Linane
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Red as the blood which flowed from stricken
deer,<br />
White as the snow on which that blood ran down,<br />
Black as the raven who drank up that blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;and possibly, as in the case of Brian Boru&rsquo;s
mother, had given his fair-haired sister in marriage to some
Irish prince, and could not resist the spell of their new creed,
and the spell too, it may be, of some sister of theirs who had
long given up all thought of earthly marriage to tend the undying
fire of St. Bridget among the consecrated virgins of Kildare.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>I am not drawing from mere imagination.&nbsp; That such
things must have happened, and happened again and again, is
certain to anyone who knows, even superficially, the documents of
that time.&nbsp; And I doubt not that, in manners as well as in
religion, the Norse were humanised and civilised by their contact
with the Celts, both in Scotland and in Ireland, Both peoples had
valour, intellect, imagination: but the Celt had that which the
burly angular Norse character, however deep and stately, and
however humorous, wanted; namely, music of nature, tenderness,
grace, rapidity, playfulness; just the qualities, combining with
the Scandinavian (and in Scotland with the Angle) elements of
character which have produced, in Ireland and in Scotland, two
schools of lyric poetry second to none in the world.</p>
<p>And so they were converted to what was then a dark and awful
creed; a creed of ascetic self-torture and purgatorial fires for
those who escaped the still more dreadful, because endless, doom
of the rest of the human race.&nbsp; But, because it was a sad
creed, it suited better men, who had, when conscience reawakened
in them, but too good reason to be sad; and the minsters and
cloisters which sprang up over the whole of Northern Europe, and
even beyond it, along the dreary western shores of Greenland
itself, are the symbols of a splendid repentance for their own
sins and for the sins of their forefathers.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Gudruna herself, of whom I spoke just now, one of those
old Norse heroines who helped to discover America, though a
historic personage, is a symbolic one likewise, and the pattern
of a whole class.&nbsp; She, too, after many journeys to Iceland,
Greenland, and Winland, goes on a pilgrimage to Rome, to get, I
presume, absolution from the Pope himself for all the sins of her
strange, rich, stormy, wayward life.</p>
<p>Have you not read&mdash;many of you surely have&mdash;La Motte
Fouqu&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>Romance of Sintram</i>?&nbsp; It
embodies all that I would say.&nbsp; It is the spiritual drama of
that early middle age; very sad, morbid if you will, but true to
fact.&nbsp; The Lady Verena ought not, perhaps, to desert her
husband, and shut herself up in a cloister.&nbsp; But so she
would have done in those old days.&nbsp; And who shall judge her
harshly for so doing?&nbsp; When the brutality of the man seems
past all cure, who shall blame the woman if she glides away into
some atmosphere of peace and purity, to pray for him whom neither
warnings nor caresses will amend?&nbsp; It is a sad book,
<i>Sintram</i>.&nbsp; And yet not too sad.&nbsp; For they were a
sad people, those old Norse forefathers of ours.&nbsp; Their
Christianity was sad; their minsters sad; there are few sadder,
though few grander, buildings than a Norman church.</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps, their Christianity did not make them
sad.&nbsp; It was but the other and the healthier <!-- page
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>side
of that sadness which they had as heathens.&nbsp; Read which you
will of the old sagas&mdash;heathen or half-Christian&mdash;the
Eyrbiggia, Viga Glum, Burnt Niall, Grettir the Strong, and, above
all, Snorri Sturluson&rsquo;s <i>Heimskringla</i>
itself&mdash;and you will see at once how sad they are.&nbsp;
There is, in the old sagas, none of that enjoyment of life which
shines out everywhere in Greek poetry, even through its deepest
tragedies.&nbsp; Not in complacency with Nature&rsquo;s beauty,
but in the fierce struggle with her wrath, does the Norseman feel
pleasure.&nbsp; Nature to him was not, as in Mr.
Longfellow&rsquo;s exquisite poem, <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a> the kind old nurse,
to take him on her knee and whisper to him, ever anew, the story
without an end.&nbsp; She was a weird witch-wife, mother of storm
demons and frost giants, who must be fought with steadily,
warily, wearily, over dreary heaths and snow-capped fells, and
rugged nesses and tossing sounds, and away into the boundless
sea&mdash;or who could live?&mdash;till he got hardened in the
fight into ruthlessness of need and greed.&nbsp; The poor strip
of flat strath, ploughed and re-ploughed again in the short
summer days, would yield no more; or wet harvests spoiled the
crops, or heavy snows starved the cattle.&nbsp; And so the
Norseman launched his ships when the lands were sown in spring,
and went forth to pillage or to trade, as luck would have, to
summerted, as he himself called it; <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>and came
back, if he ever came, in autumn to the women to help at
harvest-time, with blood upon his hand.&nbsp; But had he staid at
home, blood would have been there still.&nbsp; Three out of four
of them had been mixed up in some man-slaying, or had some
blood-feud to avenge among their own kin.</p>
<p>The whole of Scandinavia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Orkney, and
the rest, remind me ever of that terrible picture of the great
Norse painter, Tiddeman, in which two splendid youths, lashed
together, in true Norse duel fashion by the waist, are hewing
each other to death with the short axe, about some hot words over
their ale.&nbsp; The loss of life, and that of the most gallant
of the young, in those days must have been enormous.&nbsp; If the
vitality of the race had not been even more enormous, they must
have destroyed each other, as the Red Indians have done, off the
face of the earth.&nbsp; They lived these Norsemen, not to
live&mdash;they lived to die.&nbsp; For what cared they?&nbsp;
Death&mdash;what was death to them! what it was to the Jomsburger
Viking, who, when led out to execution, said to the headsman,
&lsquo;Die! with all pleasure.&nbsp; We used to question in
Jomsburg whether a man felt when his head was off?&nbsp; Now I
shall know; but if I do, take care, for I shall smite thee with
my knife.&nbsp; And meanwhile, spoil not this long hair of mine;
it is so beautiful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, oh! what waste.&nbsp; What might not these men <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>have
done if they had sought peace, not war; if they had learned a few
centuries sooner to do justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly
with their God?</p>
<p>And yet one loves them, blood-stained as they are.&nbsp; Your
own poets, men brought up under circumstances, under ideas the
most opposite to theirs, love them, and cannot help it.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; It is not merely for their bold daring, it is not
merely for their stern endurance; nor again that they had in them
that shift and thrift, those steady and common-sense business
habits, which made their noblest men not ashamed to go on voyages
of merchandise.&nbsp; Nor is it, again, that grim
humour&mdash;humour as of the modern Scotch&mdash;which so often
flashes out into an actual jest, but more usually underlies
unspoken all their deeds.&nbsp; Is it not rather that these men
are our forefathers? that their blood runs in the veins of
perhaps three men out of four in any general assembly, whether in
America or in Britain?&nbsp; Startling as the assertion may be, I
believe it to be strictly true.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I cannot read the stories of your western
men, the writings of Bret Harte, or Colonel John Hay, for
instance, without feeling at every turn that there are the old
Norse alive again, beyond the very ocean which they first
crossed, 850 years ago.</p>
<p>Let me try to prove my point, and end with a story, as I began
with one.</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>It is just 30 years before the Norman conquest of
England, the evening of the battle of Sticklestead.&nbsp; St.
Olaf&rsquo;s corpse is still lying unburied on the
hillside.&nbsp; The reforming and Christian king has fallen in
the attempt to force Christianity and despotism on the
Conservative and half-heathen party&mdash;the free bonders or
yeoman-farmers of Norway.&nbsp; Thormod, his poet,&mdash;the man,
as his name means, of thunder mood&mdash;who has been standing in
the ranks, at last has an arrow in his left side.&nbsp; He breaks
off the shaft, and thus sore wounded goes up, when all is lost,
to a farm where is a great barn full of wounded.&nbsp; One Kimbe
comes, a man out of the opposite or bonder part.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is great howling and screaming in there,&rsquo; he
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;King Olaf&rsquo;s men fought bravely enough:
but it is a shame brisk young lads cannot bear their
wounds.&nbsp; On what side wert thou in the fight?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;On the best side,&rsquo; says the beaten Thormod.&nbsp;
Kimbe sees that Thormod has a gold bracelet on his arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thou art surely a king&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; Give me thy gold
ring and I will hide thee, ere the bonders kill thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thormod said, &lsquo;Take it, if thou canst get it.&nbsp; I
have lost that which is worth more;&rsquo; and he stretched out
his left hand, and Kimbe tried to take it.&nbsp; But Thormod,
swinging his sword, cut off his hand; and it is said Kimbe
behaved no better over his wound than those he had been
blaming.</p>
<p>Then Thormod went into the barn; and after he <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>had
sung his song there in praise of his dead king, he went into an
inner room, where was a fire, and water warming, and a handsome
girl binding up men&rsquo;s wounds.&nbsp; And he sat down by the
door; and one said to him &lsquo;Why art thou so dead pale?&nbsp;
Why dost thou not call for the leech?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then sung
Thormod&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not blooming; and the fair<br />
And slender maiden loves to care<br />
For blooming youths.&nbsp; Few care for me,<br />
With Fenri&rsquo;s gold meal I can&rsquo;t fee;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth, improvising after the old Norse fashion.</p>
<p>Then Thormod got up and went to the fire, and stood and warmed
himself.&nbsp; And the nurse-girl said to him, &lsquo;Go out man,
and bring some of the split-firewood which lies outside the
door.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went out and brought an armful of wood and
threw it down.&nbsp; Then the nurse-girl looked him in the face
and said, &lsquo;Dreadful pale is this man.&nbsp; Why art thou
so?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then sang Thormod&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou wonderest, sweet bloom, at me,<br />
A man so hideous to see.<br />
The arrow-drift o&rsquo;ertook me, girl,<br />
A fine-ground arrow in the whirl<br />
Went through me, and I feel the dart<br />
Sits, lovely lass, too near my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girl said, &lsquo;Let me see thy wound.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Thormod sat down, and the girl saw his wounds, and that
which was in his side, and saw that there was a piece of iron in
it; but could not tell where it had gone.&nbsp; In a stone pot
she had leeks and other herbs, and boiled them, and gave the
wounded men of it to eat.&nbsp; But Thormod said, &lsquo;Take it
away; I have no appetite now for my broth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she
took a great pair of tongs and tried to pull out the iron; but
the wound was swelled, and there was too little to lay hold
of.&nbsp; Now said Thormod, &lsquo;Cut in so deep that thou canst
get at the iron, and give me the tongs.&rsquo;&nbsp; She did as
he said.&nbsp; Then took Thormod the gold bracelet off his hand
and gave it the nurse-girl, and bade her do with it what she
liked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a good man&rsquo;s gift,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;King Olaf gave me the ring this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Thormod took the tongs and pulled the iron out.&nbsp; But
on the iron was a barb, on which hung flesh from the heart, some
red, some white.&nbsp; When he saw that, he said, &lsquo;The king
has fed us well.&nbsp; I am fat, even to the heart&rsquo;s
roots.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so leant back and was dead.</p>
<p>I shall not insult your intelligence by any comment or even
epithet of my own.&nbsp; I shall but ask you was not this man
your kinsman?&nbsp; Does not the story sound, allowing for all
change of manners as well as of time and place, like a scene out
of your own Bret Harte or Colonel John Hay&rsquo;s writings; a
scene of <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the dry humour the rough heroism of
your own far West?&nbsp; Yes, as long as you have your <i>Jem
Bludsos</i> and <i>Tom Flynns of Virginia City</i>, the old Norse
blood is surely not extinct, the old Norse spirit is not
dead.</p>

98</span>LECTURE IV.<br />
THE SERVANT OF THE LORD.</h2>
<p>I wish to speak to you to-night about one of those old
despotic empires which were in every case the earliest known form
of civilisation.&nbsp; Were I minded to play the cynic or the
mountebank, I should choose some corrupt and effete despotism,
already grown weak and ridiculous by its decay&mdash;as did at
last the Roman and then the Byzantine Empire&mdash;and, after
raising a laugh at the expense of the old system say, See what a
superior people you are now,&mdash;how impossible, under free and
enlightened institutions, is anything so base and so absurd as
went on, even in despotic France before the Revolution of
1793.&nbsp; Well that would be on the whole true, thank God; but
what need is there to say it?</p>
<p>Let us keep our scorn for our own weaknesses, our blame for
our own sins, certain that we shall gain more instruction, though
not more amusement, by hunting out the good which is in anything
than by hunting out its evil.&nbsp; For me, true to that which I
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>proposed in my last lecture, I have chosen, not the
worst, but the best despotism which I could find in history,
founded and ruled by a truly heroic personage, one whose name has
become a proverb and a legend, that so I might lift up your
minds, even by the contemplation of an old Eastern empire, to see
that it, too, could be a work and ordinance of God, and its hero
the servant of the Lord.&nbsp; For we are almost bound to call
Cyrus, the founder of the Persian Empire, by this august title
for two reasons&mdash;First, because the Hebrew Scriptures call
him so; and next, because he proved himself to be such by his
actions and their consequences&mdash;at least in the eyes of
those who believe, as I do, in a far-seeing and far-reaching
Providence, by which all human history is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bound by gold chains unto the throne of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His work was very different from any that need be done, or can
be done, in these our days.&nbsp; But while we thank God that
such work is now as unnecessary as impossible; we may thank God
likewise that, when such work was necessary and possible, a man
was raised up to do it; and to do it, as all accounts assert,
better, perhaps, than it had ever been done before or since.</p>
<p>True, the old conquerors, who absorbed nation after nation,
tribe after tribe, and founded empires on their ruins, are now, I
trust, about to be replaced, <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>throughout
the world, as here and in Britain at home, by free self-governed
peoples&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The old order changeth, giving place to the
new;<br />
And God fulfils Himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that custom of conquest and empire and transplantation did
more than once corrupt the world.&nbsp; And yet in it, too, God
may have more than once fulfilled his own designs, as He did, if
Scripture is to be believed, in Cyrus, well surnamed the Great,
the founder of the Persian Empire some 2,400 years ago.&nbsp; For
these empires, it must be remembered, did at least that which the
Roman Empire did among a scattered number of savage tribes, or
separate little races, hating and murdering each other, speaking
different tongues, and worshipping different gods, and losing
utterly the sense of a common humanity, till they looked on the
people who dwelt in the next valley as fiends, to be sacrificed,
if caught, to their own fiends at home.&nbsp; Among such as
these, empires did introduce order, law, common speech, common
interest, the notion of nationality and humanity.&nbsp; They, as
it were, hammered together the fragments of the human race till
they had moulded them into one.&nbsp; They did it cruelly,
clumsily, ill: but was there ever work done on earth, however
noble, which was not&mdash;alas, alas!&mdash;done somewhat
ill?</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>Let me talk to you a little about the old hero.&nbsp;
He and his hardy Persians should be specially interesting to
us.&nbsp; For in them first does our race, the Aryan race, appear
in authentic history.&nbsp; In them first did our race give
promise of being the conquering and civilising race of the future
world.&nbsp; And to the conquests of Cyrus&mdash;so strangely are
all great times and great movements of the human family linked to
each other&mdash;to his conquests, humanly speaking, is owing the
fact that you are here, and I am speaking to you at this
moment.</p>
<p>It is an oft-told story: but so grand a one that I must sketch
it for you, however clumsily, once more.</p>
<p>In that mountain province called Farsistan, north-east of what
we now call Persia, the dwelling place of the Persians, there
dwelt, in the sixth and seventh centuries before Christ, a hardy
tribe, of the purest blood of Iran, a branch of the same race as
the Celtic, Teutonic, Greek, and Hindoo, and speaking a tongue
akin to theirs.&nbsp; They had wandered thither, said their
legends, out of the far north-east, from off some lofty plateau
of Central Asia, driven out by the increasing cold, which left
them but two months of summer to ten of winter.</p>
<p>They despised at first&mdash;would that they had despised
always!&mdash;the luxurious life of the dwellers in the plains,
and the effeminate customs of the Medes&mdash;a branch of their
own race who had conquered <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and
intermarried with the Turanian, or Finnish tribes; and adopted
much of their creed, as well as of their morals, throughout their
vast but short-lived Median Empire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Soft
countries,&rsquo; said Cyrus himself&mdash;so runs the
tale&mdash;&lsquo;gave birth to small men.&nbsp; No region
produced at once delightful fruits and men of a warlike
spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Letters were to them, probably then
unknown.&nbsp; They borrowed them in after years, as they
borrowed their art, from Babylonians, Assyrians, and other
Semitic nations whom they conquered.&nbsp; From the age of five
to that of twenty, their lads were instructed but in two
things&mdash;to speak the truth and to shoot with the bow.&nbsp;
To ride was the third necessary art, introduced, according to
Xenophon, after they had descended from their mountain fastnesses
to conquer the whole East.</p>
<p>Their creed was simple enough.&nbsp; Ahura Mazda&mdash;Ormuzd,
as he has been called since&mdash;was the one eternal Creator,
the source of all light and life and good.&nbsp; He spake his
word, and it accomplished the creation of heaven, before the
water, before the earth, before the cow, before the tree, before
the fire, before man the truthful, before the Devas and beasts of
prey, before the whole existing universe; before every good thing
created by Ahura Mazda and springing from Truth.</p>
<p>He needed no sacrifices of blood.&nbsp; He was to be
worshipped only with prayers, with offerings of the <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>inspiring juice of the now unknown herb Homa, and by
the preservation of the sacred fire, which, understand, was not
he, but the symbol&mdash;as was light and the sun&mdash;of the
good spirit&mdash;of Ahura Mazda.&nbsp; They had no images of the
gods, these old Persians; no temples, no altars, so says
Herodotus, and considered the use of them a sign of folly.&nbsp;
They were, as has been well said of them, the Puritans of the old
world.&nbsp; When they descended from their mountain fastnesses,
they became the iconoclasts of the old world; and the later
Isaiah, out of the depths of national shame, captivity and exile,
saw in them brother-spirits, the chosen of the Lord, whose hero
Cyrus, the Lord was holding by his right hand, till all the foul
superstitions and foul effeminacies of the rotten Semitic peoples
of the East, and even of Egypt itself, should be crushed, though
alas! only for a while, by men who felt that they had a
commission from the God of light and truth and purity, to sweep
out all that with the besom of destruction.</p>
<p>But that was a later inspiration.&nbsp; In earlier, and it may
be happier, times, the duty of the good man was to strive against
all evil, disorder, uselessness, incompetence in their more
simple forms.&nbsp; &lsquo;He therefore is a holy man,&rsquo;
says Ormuzd in the Zend-avesta, &lsquo;who has built a dwelling
on the earth, in which he maintains fire, cattle, his wife, his
children, and flocks and herds; he who makes the earth produce
barley, he <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>who cultivates the fruits of the
soil, cultivates purity; he advances the law of Ahura Mazda as
much as if he had offered a hundred sacrifices.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To reclaim the waste, to till the land, to make a corner of
the earth better than they found it, was to these men to rescue a
bit of Ormuzd&rsquo;s world out of the usurped dominion of
Ahriman; to rescue it from the spirit of evil and disorder for
its rightful owner, the Spirit of Order and of Good.</p>
<p>For they believed in an evil spirit, these old Persians.&nbsp;
Evil was not for them a lower form of good.&nbsp; With their
intense sense of the difference between right and wrong it could
be nothing less than hateful; to be attacked, exterminated, as a
personal enemy, till it became to them at last impersonate and a
person.</p>
<p>Zarathustra, the mystery of evil, weighed heavily on them and
on their great prophet, Zoroaster&mdash;splendour of gold, as I
am told his name signifies&mdash;who lived, no man knows clearly
when or clearly where, but who lived and lives for ever, for his
works follow him.&nbsp; He, too, tried to solve for his people
the mystery of evil; and if he did not succeed, who has succeeded
yet?&nbsp; Warring against Ormuzd, Ahura Mazda, was Ahriman,
Angra Mainyus, literally the being of an evil mind, the
ill-conditioned being.&nbsp; He was labouring perpetually to
spoil the good work of Ormuzd alike in nature and in man.&nbsp;
He was the <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>cause of the fall of man, the
tempter, the author of misery and death; he was eternal and
uncreate as Ormuzd was.&nbsp; But that, perhaps, was a corruption
of the purer and older Zoroastrian creed.&nbsp; With it, if
Ahriman were eternal in the past, he would not be eternal in the
future.&nbsp; Somehow, somewhen, somewhere, in the day when three
prophets&mdash;the increasing light, the increasing truth, and
the existing truth&mdash;should arise and give to mankind the
last three books of the Zend-avesta, and convert all mankind to
the pure creed, then evil should be conquered, the creation
become pure again, and Ahriman vanish for ever; and, meanwhile,
every good man was to fight valiantly for Ormuzd, his true lord,
against Ahriman and all his works.</p>
<p>Men who held such a creed, and could speak truth and draw the
bow, what might they not do when the hour and the man
arrived?&nbsp; They were not a <i>big</i> nation.&nbsp; No; but
they were a great nation, even while they were eating
barley-bread and paying tribute to their conquerors the Medes, in
the sterile valleys of Farsistan.</p>
<p>And at last the hour and the man came.&nbsp; The story is half
legendary&mdash;differently told by different authors.&nbsp;
Herodotus has one tale, Xenophon another.&nbsp; The first, at
least, had ample means of information.&nbsp; Astyages is the old
shah of the Median Empire, then at the height of its seeming
might and splendour and <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>effeminacy.&nbsp; He has married his daughter, the
princess Mandane, to Cambyses, seemingly a vassal-king or prince
of the pure Persian blood.&nbsp; One night the old man is
troubled with a dream.&nbsp; He sees a vine spring from his
daughter, which overshadows all Asia.&nbsp; He sends for the Magi
to interpret; and they tell him that Mandane will have a son who
will reign in his stead.&nbsp; Having sons of his own, and
fearing for the succession, he sends for Mandane, and, when her
child is born, gives it to Harpagus, one of his courtiers, to be
slain.&nbsp; The courtier relents, and hands it over to a
herdsman, to be exposed on the mountains.&nbsp; The herdsman
relents in turn, and brings the babe up as his own child.</p>
<p>When the boy, who goes by the name of Agradates, is grown, he
is at play with the other herd-boys, and they choose him for a
mimic king.&nbsp; Some he makes his guards, some he bids build
houses, some carry his messages.&nbsp; The son of a Mede of rank
refuses, and Agradates has him seized by his guards and chastised
with the whip.&nbsp; The ancestral instincts of command and
discipline are showing early in the lad.</p>
<p>The young gentleman complains to his father, the father to the
old king, who of course sends for the herdsman and his boy.&nbsp;
The boy answers in a tone so exactly like that in which
Xenophon&rsquo;s Cyrus would have answered, that I must believe
that both Xenophon&rsquo;s <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Cyrus and
Herodotus&rsquo; Cyrus (like Xenophon&rsquo;s Socrates and
Plato&rsquo;s Socrates) are real pictures of a real character;
and that Herodotus&rsquo; story, though Xenophon says nothing of
it, is true.</p>
<p>He has done nothing, the noble boy says, but what was
just.&nbsp; He had been chosen king in play, because the boys
thought him most fit.&nbsp; The boy whom he had chastised was one
of those who chose him.&nbsp; All the rest obeyed: but he would
not, till at last he got his due reward.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I
deserve punishment for that,&rsquo; says the boy, &lsquo;I am
ready to submit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old king looks keenly and wonderingly at the young king,
whose features seem somewhat like his own.&nbsp; Likely enough in
those days, when an Iranian noble or prince would have a quite
different cast of complexion and of face from a Turanian
herdsman.&nbsp; A suspicion crosses him; and by threats of
torture he gets the truth from the trembling herdsman.</p>
<p>To the poor wretch&rsquo;s rapture the old king lets him go
unharmed.&nbsp; He has a more exquisite revenge to take, and
sends for Harpagus, who likewise confesses the truth.&nbsp; The
wily old tyrant has naught but gentle words.&nbsp; It is best as
it is.&nbsp; He has been very sorry himself for the child, and
Mandane&rsquo;s reproaches had gone to his heart.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let Harpagus go home and send his son to be a companion to
the new-found prince.&nbsp; To-night there will be great
sacrifices in honour of the <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>child&rsquo;s safety, and Harpagus is to be a guest at
the banquet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harpagus comes; and after eating his fill, is asked how he
likes the king&rsquo;s meat?&nbsp; He gives the usual answer; and
a covered basket is put before him, out of which he is to
take&mdash;in Median fashion&mdash;what he likes.&nbsp; He finds
in it the head and hands and feet of his own son.&nbsp; Like a
true Eastern he shows no signs of horror.&nbsp; The king asks him
if he knew what flesh he had been eating.&nbsp; He answers that
he knew perfectly.&nbsp; That whatever the king did pleased
him.</p>
<p>Like an Eastern courtier, he knew how to dissemble, but not to
forgive, and bided his time.&nbsp; The Magi, to their credit,
told Astyages that his dream had been fulfilled, that
Cyrus&mdash;as we must now call the foundling prince&mdash;had
fulfilled it by becoming a king in play, and the boy is let to go
back to his father and his hardy Persian life.&nbsp; But Harpagus
does not leave him alone, nor perhaps, do his own thoughts.&nbsp;
He has wrongs to avenge on his grandfather.&nbsp; And it seems
not altogether impossible to the young mountaineer.</p>
<p>He has seen enough of Median luxury to despise it and those
who indulge in it.&nbsp; He has seen his own grandfather with his
cheeks rouged, his eyelids stained with antimony, living a
womanlike life, shut up from all his subjects in the recesses of
a vast seraglio.</p>
<p>He calls together the mountain rulers; makes friends with
Tigranes, an Armenian prince, a vassal <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of the
Mede, who has his wrongs likewise to avenge.&nbsp; And the two
little armies of foot-soldiers&mdash;the Persians had no
cavalry&mdash;defeat the innumerable horsemen of the Mede, take
the old king, keep him in honourable captivity, and so change,
one legend says, in a single battle, the fortunes of the whole
East.</p>
<p>And then begins that series of conquests of which we know
hardly anything, save the fact that they were made.&nbsp; The
young mountaineer and his playmates, whom he makes his generals
and satraps, sweep onward towards the West, teaching their men
the art of riding, till the Persian cavalry becomes more famous
than the Median had been.&nbsp; They gather to them, as a
snow-ball gathers in rolling, the picked youth of every tribe
whom they overcome.&nbsp; They knit these tribes to them in
loyalty and affection by that righteousness&mdash;that
truthfulness and justice&mdash;for which Isaiah in his grandest
lyric strains has made them illustrious to all time; which
Xenophon has celebrated in like manner in that exquisite book of
his&mdash;the <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i>.&nbsp; The great Lydian
kingdom of Cr&oelig;sus&mdash;Asia Minor as we call it
now&mdash;goes down before them.&nbsp; Babylon itself goes down,
after that world-famed siege which ended in Belshazzar&rsquo;s
feast; and when Cyrus died&mdash;still in the prime of life, the
legends seem to say&mdash;he left a coherent and well-organised
empire, which stretched from the Mediterranean to Hindostan.</p>
<p>So runs the tale, which to me, I confess, sounds <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>probable and rational enough.&nbsp; It may not do so to
you; for it has not to many learned men.&nbsp; They are inclined
to &lsquo;relegate it into the region of myth;&rsquo; in plain
English, to call old Herodotus a liar, or at least a dupe.&nbsp;
What means those wise men can have at this distance of more than
2000 years, of knowing more about the matter than Herodotus, who
lived within 100 years of Cyrus, I for myself, cannot
discover.&nbsp; And I say this without the least wish to
disparage these hypercritical persons.&nbsp; For there
are&mdash;and more there ought to be, as long as lies and
superstitions remain on this earth&mdash;a class of thinkers who
hold in just suspicion all stories which savour of the
sensational, the romantic, even the dramatic.&nbsp; They know the
terrible uses to which appeals to the fancy and the emotions have
been applied, and are still applied to enslave the intellects,
the consciences, the very bodies of men and women.&nbsp; They
dread so much from experience the abuse of that formula, that a
thing is so beautiful it must be true, that they are inclined to
reply, &lsquo;Rather let us say boldly, it is so beautiful that
it cannot be true.&nbsp; Let us mistrust, or even refuse to
believe <i>&agrave; priori</i>, and at first sight, all
startling, sensational, even poetic tales, and accept nothing as
history, which is not as dull as the ledger of a dry goods&rsquo;
store.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I think that experience, both in nature
and in society, are against that ditch-water philosophy.&nbsp;
The weather, being governed by laws, <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>ought
always to be equable and normal, and yet you have whirlwinds,
droughts, thunderstorms.&nbsp; The share-market, being governed
by laws, ought to be always equable and normal, and yet you have
startling transactions, startling panics, startling disclosures,
and a whole sensational romance of commercial crime and
folly.&nbsp; Which of us has lived to be fifty years old, without
having witnessed in private life sensation tragedies, alas!
sometimes too fearful to be told, or at least sensational
romances, which we shall take care not to tell, because we shall
not be believed?&nbsp; Let the ditch-water philosophy say what it
will, human life is not a ditch, but a wild and roaring river,
flooding its banks, and eating out new channels with many a
landslip.&nbsp; It is a strange world, and man, a strange animal,
guided, it is true, usually by most commonplace motives; but, for
that reason, ready and glad at times to escape from them and
their dulness and baseness; to give vent, if but for a moment, in
wild freedom, to that demoniac element, which, as Goethe says,
underlies his nature and all nature; and to prefer for an hour,
to the normal and respectable ditch-water, a bottle of champagne
or even a carouse on fire-water, let the consequences be what
they may.</p>
<p>How else shall we explain such a phenomenon as those old
crusades?&nbsp; Were they undertaken for any purpose, commercial
or other?&nbsp; Certainly not for lightening an overburdened
population.&nbsp; Nay, is not <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the history
of your own Mormons, and their exodus into the far West, one of
the most startling instances which the world has seen for several
centuries, of the unexpected and incalculable forces which lie
hid in man?&nbsp; Believe me, man&rsquo;s passions, heated to
igniting point, rather than his prudence cooled down to freezing
point, are the normal causes of all great human movement.&nbsp;
And a truer law of social science than any that political
economists are wont to lay down, is that old &lsquo;Dov&rsquo;
&eacute; la Donna&rsquo; of the Italian judge, who used to ask,
as a preliminary to every case, civil or criminal, which was
brought before him, &lsquo;Dov&rsquo; &eacute; la
Donna?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the lady?&rsquo; certain,
like a wise old gentleman, that a woman was most probably at the
bottom of the matter.</p>
<p>Strangeness?&nbsp; Romance?&nbsp; Did any of you ever
read&mdash;if you have not you should read&mdash;Archbishop
Whately&rsquo;s <i>Historic Doubts about the Emperor Napoleon the
First</i>?&nbsp; Therein the learned and witty Archbishop proved,
as early as 1819, by fair use of the criticism of Mr. Hume and
the Sceptic School, that the whole history of the great Napoleon
ought to be treated by wise men as a myth and a romance, that
there is little or no evidence of his having existed at all; and
that the story of his strange successes and strange defeats was
probably invented by our Government in order to pander to the
vanity of the English nation.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>I will say this, which Archbishop Whately, in a late
edition, foreshadows, wittily enough&mdash;that if one or two
thousand years hence, when the history of the late Emperor
Napoleon the Third, his rise and fall, shall come to be subjected
to critical analysis by future Philistine historians of New
Zealand or Australia, it will be proved by them to be utterly
mythical, incredible, monstrous&mdash;and that all the more, the
more the actual facts remain to puzzle their unimaginative
brains.&nbsp; What will they make, two thousand years hence, of
the landing at Boulogne with the tame eagle?&nbsp; Will not that,
and stranger facts still, but just as true, be relegated to the
region of myth, with the dream of Astyages, and the young and
princely herdsman playing at king over his fellow-slaves?</p>
<p>But enough of this.&nbsp; To me, these bits of romance often
seem the truest, as well as the most important, portions of
history.</p>
<p>When old Herodotus tells me how, King Astyages having guarded
the frontier, Harpagus sent a hunter to young Cyrus with a
fresh-killed hare, telling him to open it in private; and how,
sewn up in it was the letter, telling him that the time to rebel
was come, I am inclined to say, That must be true.&nbsp; So
beneath the dignity of history, so quaint and unexpected, it is
all the more likely <i>not</i> to have been invented.</p>
<p>So with that other story&mdash;How young Cyrus <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>giving out that his grandfather had made him general of
the Persians, summoned them all, each man with a sickle in his
hand, into a prairie full of thorns, and bade them clear it in
one day; and how when they, like loyal men, had finished, he bade
them bathe, and next day he took them into a great meadow and
feasted them with corn and wine, and all that his father&rsquo;s
farm would yield, and asked them which day they liked best; and,
when they answered as was to be expected, how he opened his
parable and told them, &lsquo;Choose, then, to work for the
Persians like slaves, or to be free with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a tale sounds to me true.&nbsp; It has the very savour of
the parables of the Old Testament; as have, surely, the dreams of
the old Sultan, with which the tale begins.&nbsp; Do they not put
us in mind of the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar, in the Book of
Daniel?</p>
<p>Such stories are actually so beautiful that they are very
likely to be true.&nbsp; Understand me, I only say likely; the
ditch-water view of history is not all wrong.&nbsp; Its advocates
are right in saying great historic changes are not produced
simply by one great person, by one remarkable event.&nbsp; They
have been preparing, perhaps, for centuries.&nbsp; They are the
result of numberless forces, acting according to laws, which
might have been foreseen, and will be foreseen, when the science
of History is more perfectly understood.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>For instance, Cyrus could not have conquered the Median
Empire at a single blow, if first that empire had not been
utterly rotten; and next, if he and his handful of Persians had
not been tempered and sharpened, by long hardihood, to the finest
cutting edge.</p>
<p>Yes, there were all the materials for the
catastrophe&mdash;the cannon, the powder, the shot.&nbsp; But to
say that the Persians must have conquered the Medes, even if
Cyrus had never lived, is to say, as too many philosophers seem
to me to say, that, given cannon, powder, and shot, it will fire
itself off some day if we only leave it alone long enough.</p>
<p>It may be so.&nbsp; But our usual experience of Nature and
Fact is, that spontaneous combustion is a rare and exceptional
phenomenon; that if a cannon is to be fired, someone must arise
and pull the trigger.&nbsp; And I believe that in Society and
Politics, when a great event is ready to be done, someone must
come and do it&mdash;do it, perhaps, half unwittingly, by some
single rash act&mdash;like that first fatal shot fired at Fort
Sumter&mdash;which makes, as by an electric spark, a whole nation
flash into enduring flame.</p>
<p>But to return to Cyrus and his Persians.</p>
<p>I know not whether the <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i> is much read in
your schools and universities.&nbsp; But it is one of the books
which I should like to see, either in a translation or its own
exquisite Greek, in the hands of every <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>young
man.&nbsp; It is not all fact.&nbsp; It is but a historic
romance.&nbsp; But it is better than history.&nbsp; It is an
ideal book, like Sidney&rsquo;s <i>Arcadia</i> or Spenser&rsquo;s
<i>Fairy Queen</i>&mdash;the ideal self-education of an ideal
hero.&nbsp; And the moral of the book&mdash;ponder it well, all
young men who have the chance or the hope of exercising authority
among your fellow-men, the noble and most Christian moral of that
heathen book is this: that the path to solid and beneficent
influence over our fellow-men lies, not through brute force, not
through cupidity, but through the highest morality; through
justice, truthfulness, humanity, self-denial, modesty, courtesy,
and all which makes man or woman lovely in the eyes of mortals or
of God.</p>
<p>Yes, the <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i> is a noble book, about a noble
personage.&nbsp; But I cannot forget that there are nobler words
by far concerning that same noble personage, in the magnificent
series of Hebrew Lyrics, which begins, &lsquo;Comfort ye, comfort
ye, my people, saith the Lord&rsquo;&mdash;in which the inspired
poet, watching the rise of Cyrus and his Puritans, and the fall
of Babylon, and the idolatries of the East, and the coming
deliverance of his own countrymen, speaks of the Persian hero in
words so grand that they have been often enough applied, and with
all fitness, to one greater than Cyrus, and than all
men:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Who raised up the righteous man from the East,<br
/>
And called him to attend his steps?<br />
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Who subdued nations at his presence,<br />
And gave him dominion over kings?<br />
And made them like the dust before his sword,<br />
And the driven stubble before his bow?<br />
He pursueth them, he passeth in safety,<br />
By a way never trodden before by his feet.<br />
Who hath performed and made these things,<br />
Calling the generations from the beginning?<br />
I, Jehovah, the first and the last, I am the same.</p>
<p>Behold my servant, whom I will uphold;<br />
My chosen, in whom my soul delighteth;<br />
I will make my spirit rest upon him,<br />
And he shall publish judgment to the nations.<br />
He shall not cry aloud, nor clamour,<br />
Nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets.<br />
The bruised reed he shall not break,<br />
And the smoking flax he shall not quench.<br />
He shall publish justice, and establish it.<br />
His force shall not be abated, nor broken,<br />
Until he has firmly seated justice in the earth,<br />
And the distant nations shall wait for his Law.<br />
Thus saith the God, even Jehovah,<br />
Who created the heavens, and stretched them out;<br />
Who spread abroad the earth, and its produce,<br />
I, Jehovah, have called thee for a righteous end,<br />
And I will take hold of thy hand, and preserve thee,<br />
And I will give thee for a covenant to the people,<br />
And for a light to the nations;<br />
To open the eyes of the blind,<br />
To bring the captives out of prison,<br />
And from the dungeon those who dwell in darkness.<br />
I am Jehovah&mdash;that is my name;<br />
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>And my glory will I not give to another,<br />
Nor my praise to the graven idols.</p>
<p>Who saith to Cyrus&mdash;Thou art my shepherd,<br />
And he shall fulfil all my pleasure:<br />
Who saith to Jerusalem&mdash;Thou shalt be built;<br />
And to the Temple&mdash;Thou shalt be founded.<br />
Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed,<br />
To Cyrus whom I hold fast by his right hand,<br />
That I may subdue nations under him,<br />
And loose the loins of kings;<br />
That I may open before him the two-leaved doors,<br />
And the gates shall not be shut;<br />
I will go before thee<br />
And bring the mountains low.<br />
The gates of brass will I break in sunder,<br />
And the bars of iron hew down.<br />
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,<br />
And the hoards hid deep in secret places,<br />
That thou mayest know that I am Jehovah.<br />
I have surnamed thee, though thou knowest not me.<br />
I am Jehovah and none else:<br />
Beside me there is no God.<br />
I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me,<br />
That they may know from the rising of the sun,<br />
And from the west, that there is none beside me;<br />
I am Jehovah, and none else;<br />
Forming light, and creating darkness;<br />
Forming peace, and creating evil.<br />
I, Jehovah, make all these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Hebrew prophet&rsquo;s conception of the great
Puritan of the Old World who went forth with <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>such a
commission as this, to destroy the idols of the East, while</p>
<blockquote><p>The isles saw that, and feared,<br />
And the ends of the earth were afraid;<br />
They drew near, they came together;<br />
Everyone helped his neighbour,<br />
And said to his brother, Be of good courage.</p>
<p>The carver encouraged the smith,<br />
He that smoothed with the hammer<br />
Him that smote on the anvil;<br />
Saying of the solder, It is good;<br />
And fixing the idol with nails, lest it be moved;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all in vain; for as the poet goes on&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bel bowed down, and Nebo stooped;<br />
Their idols were upon the cattle,<br />
A burden to the weary beast.<br />
They stoop, they bow down together;<br />
They could not deliver their own charge;<br />
Themselves are gone into captivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what, to return, what was the end of the great Cyrus and
of his empire?</p>
<p>Alas, alas! as with all human glory, the end was not as the
beginning.</p>
<p>We are scarce bound to believe positively the story how Cyrus
made one war too many, and was cut off in the Scythian deserts,
falling before the arrows of mere savages; and how their queen,
Tomyris, poured blood down the throat of the dead corpse, with
the <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>words, &lsquo;Glut thyself with the
gore for which thou hast thirsted.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it may be
true&mdash;for Xenophon states it expressly, and with
detail&mdash;that Cyrus, from the very time of his triumph,
became an Eastern despot, a sultan or a shah, living apart from
his people in mysterious splendour, in the vast fortified palace
which he built for himself; and imitating and causing his nobles
and satraps to imitate, in all but vice and effeminacy, the very
Medes whom he had conquered.&nbsp; And of this there is no
doubt&mdash;that his sons and their empire ran rapidly through
that same vicious circle of corruption to which all despotisms
are doomed, and became within 250 years, even as the Medes, the
Chaldeans, the Lydians, whom they had conquered, children no
longer of Ahura Mazda, but of Ahriman, of darkness and not of
light, to be conquered by Alexander and his Greeks even more
rapidly and more shamefully than they had conquered the East.</p>
<p>This is the short epic of the Persian Empire, ending alas! as
all human epics are wont to end, sadly, if not shamefully.</p>
<p>But let me ask you, Did I say too much, when I said, that to
these Persians we owe that we are here to-night?</p>
<p>I do not say that without them we should not have been
here.&nbsp; God, I presume, when He is minded to do anything has
more than one way of doing it.</p>
<p>But that we are to-night the last link in a chain of <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>causes and effects which reaches as far back as the
emigration of the Persians southward from the plateau of Pamir,
we cannot doubt.</p>
<p>For see.&nbsp; By the fall of Babylon and its empire the Jews
were freed from their captivity&mdash;large numbers of them at
least&mdash;and sent home to their own Jerusalem.&nbsp; What
motives prompted Cyrus, and Darius after him, to do that
deed?</p>
<p>Those who like to impute the lowest motives may say if they
will, that Daniel and the later Isaiah found it politic to
worship the rising sun, and flatter the Persian conquerors: and
that Cyrus and Darius in turn were glad to see Jerusalem rebuilt,
as an impregnable frontier fortress between them and Egypt.&nbsp;
Be it so; I, who wish to talk of things noble, pure, lovely and
of good report, would rather point you once more to the
magnificent poetry of the later Isaiah which commences at the
40th chapter of the Book of Isaiah, and say&mdash;There, upon the
very face of the document, stands written the fact that the
sympathy between the faithful Persian and the faithful
Jew&mdash;the two Puritans of the Old World, the two haters of
lies, idolatries, superstitions&mdash;was actually as intense as
it ought to have been, as it must have been.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the return of the Jews to Jerusalem
preserved for us the Old Testament, while it restored to them a
national centre, a sacred city, like that of Delphi to the
Greeks, Rome to the Romans, Mecca <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>to the
Muslim, loyalty to which prevented their being utterly absorbed
by the more civilised Eastern races among whom they had been
scattered abroad as colonies of captives.</p>
<p>Then another, and a seemingly needful link of cause and effect
ensued: Alexander of Macedon destroyed the Persian Empire, and
the East became Greek, and Alexandria, rather than Jerusalem,
became the head-quarters of Jewish learning.&nbsp; But for that
very cause, the Scriptures were not left inaccessible to the mass
of mankind, like the old Pehlevi liturgies of the Zend-avesta, or
the old Sanscrit Vedas, in an obsolete and hieratic tongue, but
were translated into, and continued in, the then all but
world-wide Hellenic speech, which was to the ancient world what
French is to the modern.</p>
<p>Then the East became Roman, without losing its Greek
speech.&nbsp; And under the wide domination of that later Roman
Empire&mdash;which had subdued and organised the whole known
world, save the Parthian descendants of those old Persians, and
our old Teutonic forefathers, in their German forests and on
their Scandinavian shores&mdash;that Divine book was carried far
and wide, East and West, and South, from the heart of Abyssinia
to the mountains of Armenia, and to the isles of the ocean,
beyond Britain itself to Ireland and to the Hebrides.</p>
<p>And that book&mdash;so strangely coinciding with the <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>old creed of the earlier Persians&mdash;that book, long
misunderstood, long overlain by the dust, and overgrown by the
parasitic fungi of centuries, that book it was which sent to
these trans-Atlantic shores the founders of your great
nation.&nbsp; That book gave them their instinct of freedom,
tempered by reverence for Law.&nbsp; That book gave them their
hatred of idolatry; and made them not only say but act upon their
own words, with these old Persians and with the Jewish prophets
alike, Sacrifice and burnt-offering thou wouldst not; then said
we, Lo, we come.&nbsp; In the volume of the book it is written of
us, that we come to do thy will, O God.&nbsp; Yes, long and
fantastic is the chain of causes and effects, which links you
here to the old heroes who came down from Central Asia, because
the land had grown so wondrous cold, that there were ten months
of winter to two of summer; and when simply after warmth and
life, and food for them and for their flocks, they wandered forth
to found and help to found a spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>And even in their migration, far back in these dim and mystic
ages, have we found the earliest link of the long chain?&nbsp;
Not so.&nbsp; What if the legend of the change of climate be the
dim recollection of an enormous physical fact?&nbsp; What if it,
and the gradual depopulation of the whole north of Asia be owing,
as geologists now suspect, to the slow and age-long uprise of the
whole of Siberia, thrusting the warm Arctic <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>sea further
and further to the northward, and placing between it and the
Highlands of Thibet an ever-increasing breadth of icy land,
destroying animals, and driving whole races southward, in search
of the summer and the sun?</p>
<p>What if the first link in the chain, as yet conceivable by
man, should be the cosmic changes in the distribution of land and
water, which filled the mouths of the Siberian rivers with frozen
carcases of woolly mammoth and rhinoceros; and those again, doubt
it not, of other revolutions, reaching back and back, and on and
on, into the infinite unknown.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; For so are
all human destinies</p>

<h2><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>LECTURE V.<br />
ANCIENT CIVILISATION.</h2>
<p>There is a theory abroad in the world just now about the
origin of the human race, which has so many patent and powerful
physiological facts to support it that we must not lightly say
that it is absurd or impossible; and that is, that man&rsquo;s
mortal body and brain were derived from some animal and ape-like
creature.&nbsp; Of that I am not going to speak now.&nbsp; My
subject is&mdash;How this creature called man, from whatever
source derived, became civilised, rational, and moral.&nbsp; And
I am sorry to say there is tacked on by many to the first theory,
another which does not follow from it, and which has really
nothing to do with it, and it is this&mdash;that man, with all
his wonderful and mysterious aspirations, always unfulfilled yet
always precious, at once his torment and his joy, his very hope
of everlasting life&mdash;that man, I say, developed himself,
unassisted, out of a state of prim&aelig;val brutishness, simply
by calculations of pleasure and pain, by observing what actions
would <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>pay in the long run and what would
not; and so learnt to conquer his selfishness by a more refined
and extended selfishness, and exchanged his brutality for
worldliness, and then, in a few instances, his worldliness for
next-worldliness.&nbsp; I hope I need not say that I do not
believe this theory.&nbsp; If I did, I could not be a Christian,
I think, nor a philosopher either.&nbsp; At least, if I thought
that human civilisation had sprung from such a dunghill as that,
I should, in honour to my race, say nothing about it, here or
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Why talk of the shame of our ancestors?&nbsp; I want to talk
of their honour and glory.&nbsp; I want to talk, if I talk at
all, about great times, about noble epochs, noble movements,
noble deeds, and noble folk; about times in which the human
race&mdash;it may be through many mistakes, alas! and sin, and
sorrow and bloodshed&mdash;struggled up one step higher on those
great stairs which, as we hope, lead upward towards the far-off
city of God; the perfect polity, the perfect civilisation, the
perfect religion, which is eternal in the heavens.</p>
<p>Of great men, then, and noble deeds I want to speak.&nbsp; I
am bound to do so first, in courtesy to my hearers.&nbsp; For in
choosing such a subject I took for granted a nobleness and
greatness of mind in them which can appreciate and enjoy the
contemplation of that which is lofty and heroic, and that which
is useful indeed, <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>though not to the purses merely or
the mouths of men, but to their intellects and spirits; that
highest philosophy which, though she can (as has been sneeringly
said of her) bake no bread, can at least do this&mdash;and she
alone&mdash;make men worthy to eat the bread which God has given
them.</p>
<p>I am bound to speak on such subjects, because I have never yet
met, or read of, the human company who did not require, now and
then at least, being reminded of such times and such
personages&mdash;of whatsoever things are just, pure, true,
lovely, and of good report, if there be any manhood and any
praise to think, as St. Paul bids us all, of such things, that we
may keep up in our minds as much as possible a lofty standard, a
pure ideal, instead of sinking to the mere selfish standard which
judges all things, even those of the world to come, by profit and
by loss, and into that sordid frame of mind in which a man grows
to believe that the world is constructed of bricks and timber,
and kept going by the price of stocks.</p>
<p>We are all tempted, and the easier and more prosperous we are,
the more we are tempted, to fall into that sordid and shallow
frame of mind.&nbsp; Sordid even when its projects are most
daring, its outward luxuries most refined; and shallow, even when
most acute, when priding itself most on its knowledge of human
nature, and of the secret springs which, so it dreams, move the
actions and make the history of <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>nations and
of men.&nbsp; All are tempted that way, even the
noblest-hearted.&nbsp; <i>Adh&aelig;sit pavimento venter</i>,
says the old psalmist.&nbsp; I am growing like the snake,
crawling in the dust, and eating the dust in which I crawl.&nbsp;
I try to lift up my eyes to the heavens, to the true, the
beautiful, the good, the eternal nobleness which was before all
time, and shall be still when time has past away.&nbsp; But to
lift up myself is what I cannot do.&nbsp; Who will help me?&nbsp;
Who will quicken me? as our old English tongue has it.&nbsp; Who
will give me life?&nbsp; The true, pure, lofty human life which I
did <i>not</i> inherit from the prim&aelig;val ape, which the
ape-nature in me is for ever trying to stifle, and make me that
which I know too well I could so easily become&mdash;a cunninger
and more dainty-featured brute?&nbsp; Death itself, which seems
at times so fair, is fair because even it may raise me up and
deliver me from the burden of this animal and mortal
body&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis life, not death, for which I pant;<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis life, whereof my nerves are scant;<br />
More life, and fuller, that I want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man?&nbsp; I am a man not by reason of my bones and muscles,
nerves and brain, which I have in common with apes and dogs and
horses.&nbsp; I am a man&mdash;thou art a man or woman&mdash;not
because we have a flesh&mdash;God forbid! but because there is a
spirit in us, a divine spark and ray, which nature did not give,
and <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>which nature cannot take away.&nbsp;
And therefore, while I live on earth, I will live to the spirit,
not to the flesh, that I may be, indeed, a <i>man</i>; and this
same gross flesh, this animal ape-nature in me, shall be the very
element in me which I will renounce, defy, despise; at least, if
I am minded to be, not a merely higher savage, but a truly higher
civilised man.&nbsp; Civilisation with me shall mean, not more
wealth, more finery, more self-indulgence&mdash;even more
&aelig;sthetic and artistic luxury; but more virtue, more
knowledge, more self-control, even though I earn scanty bread by
heavy toil; and when I compare the C&aelig;sar of Rome or the
great king, whether of Egypt, Babylon, or Persia, with the hermit
of the <i>Thebaid</i>, starving in his frock of camel&rsquo;s
hair, with his soul fixed on the ineffable glories of the unseen,
and striving, however wildly and fantastically, to become an
angel and not an ape, I will say the hermit, and not the
C&aelig;sar, is the civilised man.</p>
<p>There are plenty of histories of civilisation and theories of
civilisation abroad in the world just now, and which profess to
show you how the prim&aelig;val savage has, or at least may have,
become the civilised man.&nbsp; For my part, with all due and
careful consideration, I confess I attach very little value to
any of them: and for this simple reason that we have no
facts.&nbsp; The facts are lost.</p>
<p>Of course, if you assume a proposition as certainly <!-- page

130</span>true, it is easy enough to prove that proposition to be
true, at least to your own satisfaction.&nbsp; If you assert with
the old proverb, that you may make a silk purse out of a
sow&rsquo;s ear, you will be stupider than I dare suppose anyone
here to be, if you cannot invent for yourselves all the
intermediate stages of the transformation, however
startling.&nbsp; And, indeed, if modern philosophers had stuck
more closely to this old proverb, and its defining verb
&lsquo;make,&rsquo; and tried to show how some person or
persons&mdash;let them be who they may&mdash;men, angels, or
gods&mdash;made the sow&rsquo;s ear into the silk purse, and the
savage into the sage&mdash;they might have pleaded that they were
still trying to keep their feet upon the firm ground of actual
experience.&nbsp; But while their theory is, that the sow&rsquo;s
ear grew into a silk purse of itself, and yet unconsciously and
without any intention of so bettering itself in life; why, I
think that those who have studied the history which lies behind
them, and the poor human nature which is struggling, and sinning,
and sorrowing and failing around them, and which seems on the
greater part of this planet going downwards and not upwards, and
by no means bettering itself, save in the increase of
opera-houses, liquor-bars, and gambling-tables, and that which
pertaineth thereto; then we, I think, may be excused if we say
with the old Stoics&mdash;&#7952;&pi;&#941;&chi;&omega;&mdash;I
withhold my judgment.&nbsp; I know nothing about the <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>matter yet; and you, O my imaginative, though learned
friends, know I suspect very little either.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eldest of things, Divine Equality:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so sang poor Shelley, and with a certain truth.&nbsp; For, if,
as I believe, the human race sprang from a single pair, there
must have been among their individual descendants an equality far
greater than any which has been known on earth during historic
times.&nbsp; But that equality was at best, the infantile
innocence of the primary race, which faded away in the race as
quickly, alas! as it does in the individual child.&nbsp;
Divine&mdash;therefore it was one of the first blessings which
man lost; one of the last, I fear, to which he will return; that
to which civilisation, even at its best yet known, has not yet
attained, save here and there for short periods; but towards
which it is striving as an ideal goal, and, as I trust, not in
vain.</p>
<p>The eldest of things which we see actually as history, is not
equality, but an already developed hideous inequality, trying to
perpetuate itself, and yet by a most divine and gracious law,
destroying itself by the very means which it uses to keep itself
alive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were giants in the earth in those days, And
Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A mighty hunter; and his game was man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No; it is not equality which we see through the dim mists of
bygone ages.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>What we do see, is&mdash;I know not whether you will
think me superstitious or old-fashioned, but so I hold&mdash;very
much what the earlier books of the Bible show us under symbolic
laws.&nbsp; Greek histories, Roman histories, Egyptian histories,
Eastern histories, inscriptions, national epics, legends,
fragments of legends&mdash;in the New World as in the
Old&mdash;all tell the same story.&nbsp; Not the story without an
end, but the story without a beginning.&nbsp; As in the Hindoo
cosmogony, the world stands on an elephant, and the elephant on a
tortoise, and the tortoise on&mdash;what?&nbsp; No man
knows.&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; I only assert deliberately;
waiting, as Napoleon says, till the world come round to me, that
the tortoise does not stand&mdash;as is held by certain
anthropologists, some honoured by me, some personally dear to
me&mdash;upon the savages who chipped flints and fed on mammoth
and reindeer in North-western Europe, shortly after the age of
ice, a few hundred thousand years ago.&nbsp; These sturdy little
fellows&mdash;the kinsmen probably of the Esquimaux and
Lapps&mdash;could have been but the avant-couriers, or more
probably the fugitives from the true mass of
mankind&mdash;spreading northward from the Tropics, into climes
becoming, after the long catastrophe of the age of ice, once more
genial enough to support men who knew what decent comfort was,
and were strong enough to get the same, by all means fair or
foul.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The tortoise of the human race does not
stand on a <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>savage.&nbsp; The savage may stand
on an ape-like creature.&nbsp; I do not say that he does
not.&nbsp; I do not say that he does.&nbsp; I do not know; and no
man knows.&nbsp; But at least I say that the civilised man and
his world stand not upon creatures like to any savage now known
upon the earth.&nbsp; For first, it seems to be most unlikely;
and next, and more important to an inductive philosopher, there
is no proof of it.&nbsp; I see no savages becoming really
civilised men&mdash;that is&mdash;not merely men who will ape the
outside of our so-called civilisation, even absorb a few of our
ideas; not merely that; but truly civilised men who will think
for themselves, invent for themselves, act for themselves; and
when the sacred lamp of light and truth has been passed into
their hands, carry it on unextinguished, and transmit it to their
successors without running back every moment to get it relighted
by those from whom they received it: and who are
bound&mdash;remember that&mdash;patiently and lovingly to relight
it for them; to give freely to all their fellow-men of that which
God has given to them and to their ancestors; and let God, not
man, be judge of how much the Red Indian or the Polynesian, the
Caffre or the Chinese, is capable of receiving and of using.</p>
<p>Moreover, in history there is no record, absolutely no record,
as far as I am aware, of any savage tribe civilising
itself.&nbsp; It is a bold saying.&nbsp; I stand by my assertion:
most happy to find myself confuted, even <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>in a single
instance; for my being wrong would give me, what I can have no
objection to possess, a higher opinion than I have now, of the
unassisted capabilities of my fellow-men.</p>
<p>But civilisation must have begun somewhen, somewhere, with
some person, or some family, or some nation; and how did it
begin?</p>
<p>I have said already that I do not know.&nbsp; But I have had
my dream&mdash;like the philosopher&mdash;and as I have not been
ashamed to tell it elsewhere, I shall not be ashamed to tell it
here.&nbsp; And it is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>What if the beginnings of true civilisation in this unique,
abnormal, diseased, unsatisfied, incomprehensible, and truly
miraculous and supernatural race we call man, had been literally,
and in actual fact, miraculous and supernatural likewise?&nbsp;
What if that be the true key to the mystery of humanity and its
origin?&nbsp; What if the few first chapters of the most ancient
and most sacred book should point, under whatever symbols, to the
actual and the only possible origin of civilisation, the
education of a man, or a family by beings of some higher race
than man?&nbsp; What if the old Puritan doctrine of Election
should be even of a deeper and wider application than divines
have been wont to think?&nbsp; What if individuals, if peoples,
have been chosen out from time to time for a special
illumination, that they might be the lights of the earth, and the
salt of the world?&nbsp; What if they have, <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>each in
their turn, abused that divine teaching to make themselves the
tyrants, instead of the ministers, of the less enlightened?&nbsp;
To increase the inequalities of nature by their own selfishness,
instead of decreasing them, into the equality of grace, by their
own self-sacrifice?&nbsp; What if the Bible after all was right,
and even more right than we were taught to think?</p>
<p>So runs my dream.&nbsp; If, after I have confessed to it, you
think me still worth listening to, in this enlightened 19th
century, I will go on.</p>
<p>At all events, what we see at the beginning of all known and
half-known history, is not savagery, but high civilisation, at
least of an outward and material kind.&nbsp; Do you demur?&nbsp;
Then recollect, I pray you, that the three oldest peoples known
to history on this planet are Egypt, China, Hindostan.&nbsp; The
first glimpses of the world are always like those which the book
of Genesis gives us; like those which your own continent gives
us.&nbsp; As it was 400 years ago in America, so it was in North
Africa and in Asia 4,000 years ago, or 40,000 for aught I
know.&nbsp; Nay, if anyone should ask&mdash;And why not 400,000
years ago, on Miocene continents long sunk beneath the Tropic
sea?&nbsp; I for one have no rejoinder save&mdash;We have no
proofs as yet.</p>
<p>There loom up, out of the darkness of legend, into the as yet
dim dawn of history, what the old <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Arabs call
Races of pre-Adamite Sultans&mdash;colossal monarchies, with
fixed and often elaborate laws, customs, creeds; with
aristocracies, priesthoods&mdash;seemingly always of a superior
and conquering race; with a mass of common folk, whether free or
half-free, composed of older conquered races; of imported slaves,
too, and their descendants.</p>
<p>But whence comes the royal race, the aristocracy, the
priesthood?&nbsp; You enquire, and you find that they usually
know not themselves.&nbsp; They are usually&mdash;I had almost
dared to say, always&mdash;foreigners.&nbsp; They have crossed
the neighbouring mountains.&nbsp; They have come by sea, like
Dido to Carthage, like Manco Cassae and Mama Bello to America,
and they have sometimes forgotten when.&nbsp; At least they are
wiser, stronger, fairer, than the aborigines.&nbsp; They are to
them&mdash;as Jacques Cartier was to the Indians of
Canada&mdash;as gods.&nbsp; They are not sure that they are not
descended from gods.&nbsp; They are the Children of the Sun, or
what not.&nbsp; The children of light, who ray out such light as
they have, upon the darkness of their subjects.&nbsp; They are at
first, probably, civilisers, not conquerors.&nbsp; For, if
tradition is worth anything&mdash;and we have nothing else to go
upon&mdash;they are at first few in number.&nbsp; They come as
settlers, or even as single sages.&nbsp; It is, in all tradition,
not the many who influence the few, but the few who influence the
many.</p>
<p>So aristocracies, in the true sense, are formed.&nbsp; But
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>the higher calling is soon forgotten.&nbsp; The purer
light is soon darkened in pride and selfishness, luxury and lust;
as in Genesis, the sons of God see the daughters of men, that
they are fair; and they take them wives of all that they
choose.&nbsp; And so a mixed race springs up and increases,
without detriment at first to the commonwealth.&nbsp; For, by a
well-known law of heredity, the cross between two races, probably
far apart, produces at first a progeny possessing the forces,
and, alas! probably the vices of both.&nbsp; And when the sons of
God go in to the daughters of men, there are giants in the earth
in those days, men of renown.&nbsp; The Roman empire, remember,
was never stronger than when the old Patrician blood had mingled
itself with that of every nation round the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>But it does not last.&nbsp; Selfishness, luxury, ferocity,
spread from above, as well as from below.&nbsp; The just
aristocracy of virtue and wisdom becomes an unjust one of mere
power and privilege; that again, one of mere wealth, corrupting
and corrupt; and is destroyed, not by the people from below, but
by the monarch from above.&nbsp; The hereditary bondsmen may
know</p>
<blockquote><p>Who would be free,<br />
Himself must strike the blow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they dare not, know not how.&nbsp; The king must do it for
them.&nbsp; He must become the State.&nbsp; &lsquo;Better one
tyrant,&rsquo; as Voltaire said, &lsquo;than many.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Better <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>stand in fear of one lion far away,
than of many wolves, each in the nearest wood.&nbsp; And so arise
those truly monstrous Eastern despotisms, of which modern Persia
is, thank God, the only remaining specimen; for Turkey and Egypt
are too amenable of late years to the influence of the free
nations to be counted as despotisms pure and
simple&mdash;despotisms in which men, instead of worshipping a
God-man, worship the hideous counterfeit, a
<i>Man-god</i>&mdash;a poor human being endowed by public opinion
with the powers of deity, while he is the slave of all the
weaknesses of humanity.&nbsp; But such, as an historic fact, has
been the last stage of every civilisation&mdash;even that of
Rome, which ripened itself upon this earth the last in ancient
times, and, I had almost said, until this very day, except among
the men who speak Teutonic tongues, and who have preserved
through all temptations, and reasserted through all dangers, the
free ideas which have been our sacred heritage ever since Tacitus
beheld us, with respect and awe, among our German forests, and
saw in us the future masters of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Yes, it is very sad, the past history of mankind.&nbsp; But
shall we despise those who went before us, and on whose
accumulated labours we now stand?</p>
<p>Shall we not reverence our spiritual ancestors?&nbsp; Shall we
not show our reverence by copying them, at least whenever, as in
those old Persians, we see in <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>them
manliness and truthfulness, hatred of idolatries, and devotion to
the God of light and life and good?&nbsp; And shall we not feel
pity, instead of contempt, for their ruder forms of government,
their ignorances, excesses, failures&mdash;so excusable in men
who, with little or no previous teaching, were trying to solve
for themselves for the first time the deepest social and
political problems of humanity.</p>
<p>Yes, those old despotisms, we trust, are dead and never to
revive.&nbsp; But their corpses are the corpses, not of our
enemies, but of our friends and predecessors, slain in the
world-old fight of Ormuzd against Ahriman&mdash;light against
darkness, order against disorder.&nbsp; Confusedly they fought,
and sometimes ill: but their corpses piled the breach and filled
the trench for us, and over their corpses we step on to what
should be to us an easy victory&mdash;what may be to us, yet, a
shameful ruin.</p>
<p>For if we be, as we are wont to boast, the salt of the earth
and the light of the world, what if the salt should lose its
savour?&nbsp; What if the light which is in us should become
darkness?&nbsp; For myself, when I look upon the responsibilities
of the free nations of modern times, so far from boasting of that
liberty in which I delight&mdash;and to keep which I freely, too,
could die&mdash;I rather say, in fear and trembling, God help us
on whom He has laid so heavy a burden as to make us free;
responsible, each individual of us, not <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>only to
ourselves, but to Him and all mankind.&nbsp; For if we fall we
shall fall I know not whither, and I dare not think.</p>
<p>How those old despotisms, the mighty empires of old time,
fell, we know, and we can easily explain.&nbsp; Corrupt,
luxurious, effeminate, eaten out by universal selfishness and
mutual fear, they had at last no organic coherence.&nbsp; The
moral anarchy within showed through, at last burst through, the
painted skin of prescriptive order which held them
together.&nbsp; Some braver and abler, and usually more virtuous
people, often some little, hardy, homely mountain tribe, saw that
the fruit was ripe for gathering; and, caring nought for superior
numbers&mdash;and saying with German Alaric when the Romans
boasted of their numbers, &lsquo;The thicker the hay the easier
it is mowed&mdash;struck one brave blow at the huge inflated
wind-bag&mdash;as Cyrus and his handful of Persians struck at the
Medes; as Alexander and his handful of Greeks struck afterwards
at the Persians&mdash;and behold, it collapsed upon the
spot.&nbsp; And then the victors took the place of the conquered;
and became in their turn an aristocracy, and then a despotism;
and in their turn rotted down and perished.&nbsp; And so the
vicious circle repeated itself, age after age, from Egypt and
Assyria to Mexico and Peru.</p>
<p>And therefore, we, free peoples as we are, have need to watch,
and sternly watch, ourselves.&nbsp; Equality of some kind or
other is, as I said, our natural and seemingly <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>inevitable
goal.&nbsp; But which equality?&nbsp; For there are two&mdash;a
true one and a false; a noble and a base; a healthful and a
ruinous.&nbsp; There is the truly divine equality, and there is
the brute equality of sheep and oxen, and of flies and
worms.&nbsp; There is the equality which is founded on mutual
envy.&nbsp; The equality which respects others, and the equality
which asserts itself.&nbsp; The equality which longs to raise all
alike, and the equality which desires to pull down all
alike.&nbsp; The equality which says&mdash;Thou art as good as I,
and it may be better too, in the sight of God.&nbsp; And the
equality which says&mdash;I am as good as thou, and will
therefore see if I cannot master thee.</p>
<p>Side by side, in the heart of every free man, and every free
people, are the two instincts struggling for the mastery, called
by the same name, but bearing the same relation to each other as
Marsyas to Apollo, the Satyr to the God.&nbsp; Marsyas and
Apollo, the base and the noble, are, as in the old Greek legend,
contending for the prize.&nbsp; And the prize is no less an one
than all free people of this planet.</p>
<p>In proportion as that nobler idea conquers, and men unite in
the equality of mutual respect and mutual service, they move one
step further towards realising on earth that Kingdom of God of
which it is written&mdash;&lsquo;The despots of the nations
exercise dominion over them, and they that exercise authority
over them are called benefactors.&nbsp; But he that will be great
among you let him be the servant of all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>And in proportion as that base idea conquers, and
selfishness, not self-sacrifice, is the ruling spirit of a State,
men move on, one step forward towards realising that kingdom of
the devil upon earth, &lsquo;Every man for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only, alas! in that evil equality
of envy and hate, there is no hindmost, and the devil takes them
all alike.</p>
<p>And so is a period of discontent, revolution, internecine
anarchy, followed by a tyranny endured, as in old Rome, by men
once free, because tyranny will at least do for them, what they
were too lazy and greedy and envious to do for themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>And all because they have forgot<br />
What &rsquo;tis to be a man&mdash;to curb and spurn<br />
The tyrant in us: the ignobler self<br />
Which boasts, not loathes, its likeness to the brute;<br />
And owns no good save ease, no ill save pain,<br />
No purpose, save its share in that wild war<br />
In which, through countless ages, living things<br />
Compete in internecine greed.&nbsp; Ah, loving God,<br />

Tigers, who slay with cannon and sharp steel,<br />
Instead of teeth and claws:&mdash;all these we are.<br />
Are we no more than these, save in degree?<br />

Eats what he lists.&nbsp; The strong eat up the weak;<br />
The many eat the few; great nations, small;<br />
And he who cometh in the name of all<br />
Shall, greediest, triumph by the greed of all,<br />
And, armed by his own victims, eat up all.<br />
While ever out of the eternal heavens<br />
Looks patient down the great magnanimous God,<br />
Who, Master of all worlds, did sacrifice<br />
All to Himself?&nbsp; Nay: but Himself to all;<br />
Who taught mankind, on that first Christmas Day,<br />
What &rsquo;tis to be a man&mdash;to give, not take;<br />
To serve, not rule; to nourish, not devour;<br />
To lift, not crush; if need, to die, not live.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He that cometh in the name of all&rsquo;&mdash;the
popular military despot&mdash;the &lsquo;saviour of his
country&rsquo;&mdash;he is our internecine enemy on both sides of
the Atlantic, whenever he arises&mdash;the inaugurator of that
Imperialism, that C&aelig;sarism into which Rome sank, when not
her liberties merely, but her virtues, were decaying out of
her&mdash;the sink into which all wicked States, whether
republics or monarchies, are sure to fall, simply because men
must eat and drink for to-morrow they die.&nbsp; The Military and
Bureaucratic Despotism which <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>keeps the
many quiet, as in old Rome, by <i>panem et
Circenses</i>&mdash;bread and games&mdash;or if need be,
Pilgrimages; that the few may make money, eat, drink, and be
merry, as long as it can last.&nbsp; That, let it ape as it
may&mdash;as did the C&aelig;sars of old Rome at first&mdash;as
another Emperor did even in our own days&mdash;the forms of dead
freedom, really upholds an artificial luxury by brute force; and
consecrates the basest of all aristocracies, the aristocracy of
the money bag, by the divine sanction of the bayonet.</p>
<p>That at all risks, even at the price of precious blood, the
free peoples of the earth must ward off from them; for, makeshift
and stop-gap as it is, it does not even succeed in what it tries
to do.&nbsp; It does not last.&nbsp; Have we not seen that it
does not, cannot last?&nbsp; How can it last.&nbsp; This
falsehood, like all falsehoods, must collapse at one touch of
Ithuriel&rsquo;s spear of truth and fact.&nbsp; And&mdash;</p>

dost set them in slippery places, and casteth them down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suddenly do they perish, and come to a fearful

make their image to vanish out of the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Have we not seen that too, though, thank God, neither in
England nor in the United States?</p>
<p>And then?&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; None knows, and none can
know.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>The future of France and Spain, the future of the
Tropical Republics of Spanish America, is utterly blank and dark;
not to be prophesied, I hold, by mortal man, simply because we
have no like cases in the history of the past whereby to judge
the tendencies of the present.&nbsp; Will they revive?&nbsp;
Under the genial influences of free institutions will the good
seed which is in them take root downwards, and bear fruit
upwards? and make them all what that fair France has been, in
spite of all her faults, so often in past years&mdash;a joy and
an inspiration to all the nations round?&nbsp; Shall it be
thus?&nbsp; God grant it may; but He, and He alone, can
tell.&nbsp; We only stand by, watching, if we be wise, with pity
and with fear, the working out of a tremendous new social
problem, which must affect the future of the whole civilised
world.</p>

<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>And we, who think we stand, let us take heed lest we
fall.&nbsp; Let us accept, in modesty and in awe, the
responsibility of our freedom, and remember that that freedom can
be preserved only in one old-fashioned way.&nbsp; Let us remember
that the one condition of a true democracy is the same as the one
condition of a true aristocracy, namely, virtue.&nbsp; Let us
teach our children, as grand old Lilly taught our forefathers 300
years ago&mdash;&lsquo;It is virtue, gentlemen, yea, virtue that
maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the subject a king,
the lowborn noble, the deformed beautiful.&nbsp; These things
neither the whirling wheel of fortune can overturn, nor the
deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness
abate, nor age abolish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Let us teach our children thus on both sides of the
Atlantic.&nbsp; For if they&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;should
grow corrupt and weak by their own sins, there is no hardier race
now left on earth to conquer our descendants and bring them back
to reason, as those old Jews were brought, by bitter shame and
woe.&nbsp; And all that is before them and the whole civilised
world, would be long centuries of anarchy such as the world has
not seen for ages&mdash;a true Ragnarok, a twilight of the very
gods, an age such as the wise woman foretold in the old
Volusp&agrave;.</p>

Hard will be that age,<br />
An age of bad women,<br />
An axe-age, a sword-age,<br />
Shields oft cleft in twain,<br />
A storm-age, a wolf-age,<br />
Ere earth meet its doom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sang, 2,000 years ago, perhaps, the great unnamed
prophetess of our own race, of what might be, if we should fail
mankind and our own calling and election.</p>
<p>God grant that day may never come.&nbsp; But God grant, also,
that if that day does come, then may come true also what that
wise Vala sang, of the day when gods, and men, and earth should
be burnt up with fire.</p>
<blockquote><p>When slaked Surtur&rsquo;s flame is,<br />
Still the man and the maiden,<br />
Hight Valour and Life,<br />
Shall keep themselves hid<br />
In the wood of remembrance.<br />
The dew of the dawning<br />
For food it shall serve them;<br />
From them spring new peoples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New peoples.&nbsp; For after all is said, the ideal form of
human society is democracy.</p>
<p>A nation&mdash;and, were it even possible, a whole <!-- page

and Nature; calling no man master&mdash;for one is their master,
even God; knowing and obeying their duties towards the Maker of
the Universe, and therefore to each other, and that not from
fear, nor calculation of profit or loss, but because they loved
and liked it, and had seen the beauty of righteousness and trust
and peace; because the law of God was in their hearts, and
needing at last, it may be, neither king nor priest, for each man
and each woman, in their place, were kings and priests to
God.&nbsp; Such a nation&mdash;such a society.&nbsp; What nobler
conception of mortal existence can we form?&nbsp; Would not that
be, indeed, the kingdom of God come on earth?</p>
<p>And tell me not that that is impossible&mdash;too fair a dream
to be ever realised.&nbsp; All that makes it impossible is the
selfishness, passions, weaknesses, of those who would be blest
were they masters of themselves, and therefore of circumstances;
who are miserable because, not being masters of themselves, they
try to master circumstance, to pull down iron walls with weak and
clumsy hands, and forget that he who would be free from tyrants
must first be free from his worst tyrant, self.</p>
<p>But tell me not that the dream is impossible.&nbsp; It is so
beautiful that it must be true.&nbsp; If not now, nor centuries
hence, yet still hereafter.&nbsp; God would never, as I hold,
have inspired man with that rich imagination <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>had he not
meant to translate, some day, that imagination into fact.</p>
<p>The very greatness of the idea, beyond what a single mind or
generation can grasp, will ensure failure on
failure,&mdash;follies, fanaticisms, disappointments, even
crimes, bloodshed, hasty furies, as of children baulked of their
holiday.</p>
<p>But it will be at last fulfilled, filled full, and perfected;
not perhaps here, or among our peoples, or any people which now
exist on earth: but in some future civilisation&mdash;it may be
in far lands beyond the sea&mdash;when all that you and we have
made and done shall be as the forest-grown mounds of the old
nameless civilisers of the Mississippi valley.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
